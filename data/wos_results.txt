J	Naevdal, E; Olaussen, JO; Skonhoft, A				Naevdal, Eric; Olaussen, Jon Olaf; Skonhoft, Anders			A bioeconomic model of trophy hunting	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												During the last few decades wildlife trophy hunting has increasingly replaced traditional meat hunting. The economics of trophy hunting is analyzed with the Scandinavian moose (Alces alces) serving as an example. A four-stage model (calf, yearlings, adult female and adult male) is formulated. The calves, yearlings, and females are hunted for meat, while the males are hunted for trophies and where the demand for trophy hunting depends on price and quality. We find that trophy hunting boosts the male population and yields a high ratio of males to females. The main reason for this result is that we consider a management scheme with well defined property rights and not of the 'open-access' type, and where the key mechanism is the quality demand effect in trophy hunting. In an extended model where ecological theory of animal adoption to hunting is assumed to influence the biology through fertility we still find that trophy hunting boosts the male stock.

J	Heffelfinger, JR				Heffelfinger, James R.			Inefficiency of evolutionarily relevant selection in ungulate trophy hunting	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Differentially harvesting individual animals with specific traits has led some to argue that such selection can cause evolutionary change that may be detrimental to the species, especially if those traits are related positively to individual fitness. Most hunters are not selective in the type of animal they take, satisfied instead to harvest any legal animal. In a few exceptions, however, regulations may limit hunters to harvest animals of a minimum size or age regardless of their personal choice. Using information from a broad range of aquatic and terrestrial systems exposed to a myriad of potential and operational selective pressures, several authors have made expansive generalizations about selective harvest and its applicability to ungulates. Harvest-based selection can potentially be intensive enough to be relevant in an evolutionary sense, but phenotypic changes consistent with hunter selection are otherwise confounded with multiple environmental influences. Factors such as age, genetic contribution of females, nutrition, maternal effects, epigenetics, patterns of mating success, gene linkage, gene flow, refugia, date of birth, and other factors affecting selection interact with harvest to impede unidirectional evolution of a trait. The intensity of selection determines potential for evolutionary change in a meaningful temporal framework. Indeed, only under severe intensity, and strict selection on a trait, could human harvest prompt evolutionary changes in that trait. Broad generalizations across populations or ecological systems can yield erroneous extrapolations and inappropriate assumptions. Removal of males expressing a variety of horn or antler sizes, including some very large males, does not inevitably represent directional artificial selection unless the selective pressures are intensive enough to cause a unidirectional shift in allele frequencies that may act on some relevant life-history trait or process. Here I review the topic of harvest-based selection in male ungulates and discuss the inefficiency of trophy hunting in changing genetic expression of phenotype. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society. Removal of males expressing a variety of horn and antler sizes, including some very large males, does not inevitably represent directional artificial selection unless the selective pressures are intensive enough to cause a unidirectional shift in phenotype or allele frequencies that may act on some relevant life-history trait or process. Restraint should be exercised in calling for management changes by extrapolating from relatively unique and isolated populations, single genera, or uncommon harvest paradigms to more diverse units of conservation.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				JAN	2018	82	1			SI		57	66		10.1002/jwmg.21337	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.21337													WOS:000417629600006

Rarity, trophy hunting and ungulates	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												The size and shape of a trophy constitute major determinants of its value. We postulate that the rarity of a species, whatever its causes, also plays a major role in determining its value among hunters. We investigated a role for an Anthropogenic Allee effect in trophy hunting, where human attraction to rarity could lead to an over-exploitative chain reaction that could eventually drive the targeted species to extinction. We performed an inter-specific analysis of trophy prices of 202 ungulate taxa and quantified to what extent morphological characteristics and their rarity accounted for the observed variation in their price. We found that once location and body mass were accounted for, trophies of rare species attain higher prices than those of more common species. By driving trophy price increase, this rarity effect may encourage the exploitation of rare species regardless of their availability, with potentially profound consequences for populations.

Predicting the evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting on a quantitative trait	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Some ecologists suggest that trophy hunting (e.g., harvesting males with a desirable trait above a certain size) can lead to rapid phenotypic change, which has led to an ongoing discussion about evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting. Claims of rapid evolution come from the statistical analyses of data, with no examination of whether these results are theoretically plausible. We constructed simple quantitative genetic models to explore how a range of hunting scenarios affects the evolution of a trophy such as horn length. We show that trophy hunting does lead to trophy evolution defined as change in the mean breeding value of the trait. However, the fastest rates of phenotypic change attributable to trophy hunting via evolution that are theoretically possible under standard assumptions of quantitative genetics are 1-2 orders of magnitude slower than the fastest rates of phenotypic change reported from statistical analyses. Our work suggests a re-evaluation of the likely evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting would be appropriate when setting policy. Our work does not consider the ethical or ecological consequences of trophy hunting. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society. We show that the widely cited results claiming rapid evolution of trophy size in bighorn sheep in response to selective trophy hunting are theoretically impossible given standard assumptions of quantitative genetics.

Here we show that in an evolutionary response to sport hunting of bighorn trophy rams ( Ovis canadensis) body weight and horn size have declined significantly over time. We used quantitative genetic analyses, based on a partly genetically reconstructed pedigree from a 30- year study of a wild population in which trophy hunting targeted rams with rapidly growing horns(4), to explore the evolutionary response to hunter selection on ram weight and horn size. Both traits were highly heritable, and trophy- harvested rams were of significantly higher genetic ' breeding value' for weight and horn size than rams that were not harvested. Rams of high breeding value were also shot at an early age, and thus did not achieve high reproductive success(5). Declines in mean breeding values for weight and horn size therefore occurred in response to unrestricted trophy hunting, resulting in the production of smaller- horned, lighter rams, and fewer trophies.

J	Whitman, KL; Starfield, AM; Quadling, H; Packer, C				Whitman, Karyl L.; Starfield, Anthony M.; Quadling, Henley; Packer, Craig			Modeling the effects of trophy selection and environmental disturbance on a simulated population of African lions	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY					Symposium on the Contribution of Long-Term Studies to Conservation	DEC, 2003	TANZANIA	Tanzania Wildlife Res Inst				Tanzania is a premier destination for trophy hunting of African lions (Panthera leo) and is home to the most extensive long-term study of unhunted lions. Thus, it provides a unique opportunity to apply data from a long-term field study to a conservation dilemma: How can a trophy-hunted species whose reproductive success is closely tied to social stability be harvested sustainably? We used an individually based, spatially explicit, stochastic model, parameterized with nearly 40 years of behavioral and demographic data on lions in the Serengeti, to examine the separate effects of trophy selection and environmental disturbance on the viability of a simulated lion population in response to annual harvesting. Female population size was sensitive to the harvesting of young males (>= 3 years), whereas hunting represented a relatively trivial threat to population viability when the harvest was restricted to mature males (> 6years). Overall model performance was robust to environmental disturbance and to errors in age assessment based on nose coloration as an index used to age potential trophies. Introducing an environmental disturbance did not eliminate the capacity to maintain a viable breeding population when harvesting only older males, and initially depleted populations recovered within 15-25 years after the disturbance to levels comparable to hunted populations that did not experience a catastrophic event. These results are consistent with empirical observations of lion resilience to environmental stochasticity.																			0888-8892	1523-1739				JUN	2007	21	3					591	601		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00700.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00700.x								17531038					WOS:000246843200006

Ewe are what ewe wear: bigger horns, better ewes and the potential consequence of trophy hunting on female fitness in bighorn sheep	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												In polygynous species, secondary sexual traits such as weapons or elaborate ornaments have evolved through intrasexual competition for mates. In some species, these traits are present in both sexes but are underdeveloped in the sex facing lower intrasexual competition for mates. It is often assumed that these underdeveloped sexually selected traits are a vestige of strong sexual selection on the other sex. Here, we challenge this assumption and investigate whether the expression of secondary sexual traits is associated with fitness in female bighorn sheep. Analyses of 45 years of data revealed that female horn length at 2 years, while accounting for mass and environmental variables, is associated with younger age at primiparity, younger age of first offspring weaned, greater reproductive lifespan and higher lifetime reproductive success. There was no association between horn length and fecundity. These findings highlight a potential conservation issue. In this population, trophy hunting selects against males with fast-growing horns. Intersexual genetic correlations imply that intense selective hunting of large-horned males before they can reproduce can decrease female horn size. Therefore, intense trophy hunting of males based on horn size could reduce female reproductive performance through the associations identified here, and ultimately reduce population growth and viability.					; Coltman, David/HZL-7279-2023; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/AER-0364-2022; Miller, Joshua/E-3072-2013	Pelletier, Fanie/0000-0002-0113-5412; Deakin, Samuel/0000-0003-4227-8767; Coltman, David/0000-0002-1268-2307; Miller, Joshua/0000-0002-4019-7675													0962-8452	1471-2954				MAR 30	2022	289	1971							20212534	10.1098/rspb.2021.2534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.2534								35317671					WOS:000784192600006

Selective hunting can affect demographic characteristics and phenotypic traits of the targeted species. Hunting systems often involve harvesting quotas based on sex, age and/or size categories to avoid selective pressure. However, it is difficult to assess whether such regulations deter hunters from targeting larger "trophy" animals with longer horns that may have evolutionary consequences. 2. Here, we compile 44,088 annually resolved and absolutely dated measurements of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) horn growth increments from 8,355 males, harvested between 1978 and 2013, in the eastern Swiss Canton of Grisons. We aim to determine whether male ibex with longer horns were preferentially targeted, causing animals with early rapid horn growth to have shorter lives, and whether such hunting selection translated into long-term trends in horn size over the past four decades. 3. Results show that medium-to longer-horned adult males had a higher probability of being harvested than shorter-horned individuals of the same age and that regulations do affect the hunters' behaviour. Nevertheless, phenotypic traits such as horn length, as well as body size and weight, remained stable over the study period. 4. Although selective trophy hunting still occurs, it did not cause a measurable evolutionary response in Grisons' Alpine ibex populations; managed and surveyed since 1978. Nevertheless, further research is needed to understand whether phenotypic trait development is coinfluenced by other, potentially compensatory factors that may possibly mask the effects of selective, long-term hunting pressure.					buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013; Hülsmann, Lisa/B-6680-2017; Mysterud, Atle/AFL-1958-2022	Senn, Josef/0000-0002-7626-1843; Hülsmann, Lisa/0000-0003-4252-2715; Bollmann, Kurt/0000-0002-4690-7121; Mysterud, Atle/0000-0001-8993-7382													0021-8790	1365-2656				JUL	2018	87	4			SI		1069	1079		10.1111/1365-2656.12839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12839								29676473					WOS:000435940700015
J	Mysterud, A; Bischof, R				Mysterud, Atle; Bischof, Richard			Can compensatory culling offset undesirable evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting?	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												P> There is growing concern about the evolutionary consequences of human harvesting on phenotypic trait quality in wild populations. Undesirable consequences are especially likely with trophy hunting because of its strong bias for specific phenotypic trait values, such as large antlers in cervids and horns in bovids. Selective hunting can cause a decline in a trophy trait over time if it is heritable, thereby reducing the long-term sustainability of the activity itself. How can we build a sustainable trophy hunting tradition without the negative trait-altering effects? We used an individual-based model to explore whether selective compensatory culling of 'low quality' individuals at an early life stage can facilitate sustainability, as suggested by information from managed game populations in eastern and central Europe. Our model was rooted in empirical data on red deer, where heritability of sexual ornaments has been confirmed and phenotypic quality can be assessed by antler size in individuals as young as 1 year. Simulations showed that targeted culling of low-quality yearlings could counter the selective effects of trophy hunting on the distribution of the affected trait (e.g. antler or horn size) in prime-aged individuals. Assumptions of trait heritability and young-to-adult correlation were essential for compensation, but the model proved robust to various other assumptions and changes to input parameters. The simulation approach allowed us to verify responses as evolutionary changes in trait values rather than short-term consequences of altered age structure, density and viability selection. We conclude that evolutionarily enlightened management may accommodate trophy hunting. This has far reaching implications as income from trophy hunting is often channelled into local conservation efforts and rural economies. As an essential follow-up, we recommend an analysis of the effects of trophy hunting in conjunction with compensatory culling on the phenotypic and underlying genetic variance of the trophy trait.

Effects of Trophy Hunting on Lion and Leopard Populations in Tanzania	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Tanzania holds most of the remaining large populations of African lions (Panthera leo) and has extensive areas of leopard habitat (Panthera pardus), and both species are subjected to sizable harvests by sport hunters. As a first step toward establishing sustainable management strategies, we analyzed harvest trends for lions and leopards across Tanzania's 300,000 km2 of hunting blocks. We summarize lion population trends in protected areas where lion abundance has been directly measured and data on the frequency of lion attacks on humans in high-conflict agricultural areas. We place these findings in context of the rapidly growing human population in rural Tanzania and the concomitant effects of habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and cultural practices. Lion harvests declined by 50% across Tanzania between 1996 and 2008, and hunting areas with the highest initial harvests suffered the steepest declines. Although each part of the country is subject to some form of anthropogenic impact from local people, the intensity of trophy hunting was the only significant factor in a statistical analysis of lion harvest trends. Although leopard harvests were more stable, regions outside the Selous Game Reserve with the highest initial leopard harvests again showed the steepest declines. Our quantitative analyses suggest that annual hunting quotas be limited to 0.5 lions and 1.0 leopard/1000 km2 of hunting area, except hunting blocks in the Selous Game Reserve, where harvests should be limited to 1.0 lion and 3.0 leopards/1000 km2.																			0888-8892					FEB	2011	25	1					142	153		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01576.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01576.x								20825444					WOS:000286380500017
J	Poisson, Y; Festa-Bianchet, M; Pelletier, F				Poisson, Yoanna; Festa-Bianchet, Marco; Pelletier, Fanie			Testing the importance of harvest refuges for phenotypic rescue of trophy-hunted populationsMots-cles	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Sustainable exploitation must minimize its impact on the ecology and evolution of exploited wildlife. Intense phenotype-based selective harvests can induce evolutionary change. Refuges could mitigate those evolutionary effects if individuals not subject to selective hunting in harvest refuges migrated and reproduced in hunted areas. The role of harvest refuges on phenotypic rescue of trophy-hunted species, however, has rarely been tested. We investigated spatial and temporal variation in the effect of refuges on horn size and age at harvest in bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis. We analysed data on 5,826 males harvested over 39 years in Alberta, Canada. Horn length, a trait targeted by hunters, and age at harvest increased with the amount of protected areas 5-40 km around each kill. Horn base circumference, however, was independent of proximity to refuges. The number of males harvested increased during the last 10 days of the hunting season in late October, corresponding to the timing of bighorn male breeding migrations. Males shot during those 10 days were on average 17% closer to a refuge than males shot earlier in the season. Apparently, some large males exit refuges late in the hunting season, are shot, and cannot contribute to rescue. Uncertainty remains about the proportion of males exiting refuges after the hunting season and how many survive to reproduce. Synthesis and applications. Harvest refuges are unlikely to rescue hunted populations of bighorn sheep in Alberta, because some males exiting refuges are at risk of harvest before they mate. For phenotypic rescue to be effective, unselected males must reproduce before they are shot. Closing the hunting season 10 days earlier would increase survival of unselected rams exiting refuges.					; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/AER-0364-2022	Poisson, Yoanna/0000-0001-7884-4818; Pelletier, Fanie/0000-0002-0113-5412; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/0000-0002-2352-3379													0021-8901	1365-2664				MAR	2020	57	3					526	535		10.1111/1365-2664.13562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13562		FEB 2020											WOS:000510500800001

The article concludes that there are "... stable or increasing trends in horn growth over nearly 3 decades in the majority of hunt areas throughout the western U.S. and Canada." However, the article equates nonsignificance of predominantly negative trends in the areas with the most selective harvest as evidence for the null hypothesis of no trends and also fails to consider well-known and serious biases in the use of data collected in size-regulated hunts. By applying meta-analysis to the estimates reported by LaSharr et al., we show that there has been a pervasive overall trend of declining horn sizes in Alberta, where the combination of horn size-based legality, combined with unrestricted hunter numbers are understood to generate the greatest selective pressures. Given the nature of the biases in the underlying data, the magnitudes of the trends resulting from our re-analysis of LaSharr et al.'s (Evolutionary Applications, 2019, 12, 1823) trend estimates are probably underestimated.

For large herbivores, trophy hunting removes males with large horns. That artificial selection, operating in opposition to sexual selection, can lead to undesirable consequences for management and conservation. There have been no comparisons of long-term changes in trophy size under contrasting harvest pressures. We analyzed horn measurements of Stone's rams (Ovis dalli stonei) harvested over 37 years in two large regions of British Columbia, Canada, with marked differences in hunting pressure to identify when selective hunting may cause a long-term decrease in horn growth. Under strong selective harvest, horn growth early in life and the number of males harvested declined by 12% and 45%, respectively, over the study period. Horn shape also changed over time: horn length became shorter for a given base circumference, likely because horn base is not a direct target of hunter selection. In contrast, under relatively lower hunting pressure, there were no detectable temporal trends in early horn growth, number of males harvested, or horn length relative to base circumference. Trophy hunting is an important recreational activity and can generate substantial revenues for conservation. By providing a reproductive advantage to males with smaller horns and reducing the availability of desirable trophies, however, excessive harvest may have the undesirable long-term consequences of reducing both the harvest and the horn size of rams. These consequences can be avoided by limiting offtake.

Aging traits and sustainable trophy hunting of African lions	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Trophy hunting plays a significant role in wildlife conservation in some contexts in various parts of the world. Yet excessive hunting is contributing to species declines, especially for large carnivores. Simulation models suggest that sustainable hunting of African lions may be achieved by restricting offtakes to males old enough to have reared a cohort of offspring. We tested and expanded criteria for an age-based approach for sustainably regulating lion hunting. Using photos of 228 known-age males from ten sites across Africa, we measured change in ten phenotypic traits with age and found four age classes with distinct characteristics: 1-2.9 years, 3-4.9 years, 5-6.9 years, and >= 7 years. We tested the aging accuracy of professional hunters and inexperienced observers before and after training on aging. Before training, hunters accurately aged more lion photos (63%) than inexperienced observers (48%); after training, both groups improved (67-69%). Hunters overestimated 22% of lions <5 years as 5-6.9 years (unsustainable) but only 4% of lions <5 years as >= 7 years (sustainable). Due to the lower aging error for males >= 7 years, we recommend 7 years as a practical minimum age for hunting male lions. Results indicate that age-based hunting is feasible for sustainably managing threatened and economically significant species such as the lion, but must be guided by rigorous training, strict monitoring of compliance and error, and conservative quotas.

Age at harvest increased over time, suggesting slower horn growth. Rams that experienced favorable environmental conditions early in life had rapid horn growth and were harvested at a younger age than rams with slower horn growth. Guided nonresident hunters did not harvest larger rams than residents, suggesting that few large rams were available. Resident hunter success declined in recent years. Despite an apparently stable population, successive cohorts produced a decreasing harvest of trophy rams. We suggest that unrestricted harvest based on a threshold horn size led to a decline in the availability of trophy rams. That decline is partly an inevitable consequence of selective hunting that removes larger rams. Although our analysis does not establish that evolution of smaller horns caused the observed decline in both horn size and harvest of trophy rams, we suggest that intensive trophy hunting may have artificially selected for a decrease in horn growth rate.

We analysed temporal trends in horn size in two mountain ungulates from south-eastern Spain, the Iberian wild goat Capra pyrenaica and the aoudad Ammotragus lervia. Trophy harvest is the main way in which these two species are exploited, although 'poor-quality aoudads are also selectively removed. In recent years, both populations have suffered drastic decreases in number due to outbreaks of sarcoptic mange that led to the suspension of hunting for several years. Horn length in harvested male wild goats and aoudads declined during our study period. Over an 18-year period, the mean age of male goats shot as trophies rose by four years, while the age of trophy-harvested aoudads decreased by around six months over a 9-year period. Age and environmental conditions during the first few years of life explained 20% of variance in horn size in Iberian wild goat and 53% in aoudad. Population density early in life explained much of the reduction in goat horn size over time. Nevertheless, the major fall in population densities after the sarcoptic mange outbreaks did not lead to a recovery in horn size in either species. We suggest that the selective removal of large-horned animals may contribute to a decline in horn size. Other factors that may also explain the observed pattern include changes in interspecific competition, long-lasting maternal effects and reduced carrying capacity due to overgrazing during high density periods. Unfortunately, our data sets did not allow us to account for the possible effects of these factors.

In wild ungulate populations, unrestricted trophy hunting may cause strong selection pressures resulting in evolutionary change towards smaller trophies. It has rarely been tested how harvesting selection varies in space and time, and whether directional hunter selection is sufficiently strong to induce long-term decreases in trophy size in century-scale data. We analysed two unique data sets of harvesting records spanning decade (19732008) and century scales (18812008) to identify changes in trophy size and how harvesting selection varies in space and time in red deer Cervus elaphus. We contrasted predictions from the trophy-hunting depletion, the restricted trophy hunting and the hunting pressure hypotheses. Foreign hunters selected older and larger males than local hunters, but selection patterns for age-specific trophy size between counties and over time were dynamic. Patterns of red deer trophy size development from exhibitions (representing the upper tail' of antler sizes) were remarkably similar across Hungary from 1881 to 2008. A weak decline in trophy size between 1881 and 1958 was followed by a strong increase in trophy size between 1958 and 1974, culminating in a period of stable antler tine numbers and a weak decline in beam length until 2008. We rejected the trophy hunting depletion hypothesis due to the increase in trophy size after a period of decline; patterns were most consistent with the hunting pressure hypothesis. Large increases in trophy size during 19581974 were likely due to a relief in hunting pressure due to implementation of strict management regulations allowing stags to grow old after the massive overharvesting during World War II, but we cannot exclude impacts from environmental factors, and that data from trophy exhibitions may underestimate trends. Synthesis and applications. Trophy hunting does not necessarily lead to a non-reversible decline in trophy size, even over century-long time-scales. To ensure sustainable trophy hunting management, we need to consider factors such as spatial and temporal refuges, compensatory culling, saving stags until prime-age culmination and higher prices for larger trophies.

ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Weaponry in ungulates may be costly to grow and maintain, and different selective pressures in males and females may lead to sex-biased natural survival. Sexual differences in the relationship between weapon growth and survival may increase under anthropogenic selection through culling, for example because of trophy hunting. Selection on weaponry growth under different scenarios has been largely investigated in males of highly dimorphic ungulates, for which survival costs (either natural or hunting related) are thought to be greatest. Little is known, however, about the survival costs of weaponry in males and females of weakly dimorphic species. We collected information on horn length and age at death/shooting of 407 chamois Rupicapra rupicapra in a protected population and in two hunted populations with different hunting regimes, to explore sexual differences in the selection on early horn growth under contrasting selective pressures. We also investigated the variation of horn growth and body mass in yearling males (n=688) and females (n=539) culled in one of the hunted populations over 14years. The relationship between horn growth and survival showed remarkable sexual differences under different evolutionary scenarios. Within the protected population, under natural selection, we found no significant trade-off in either males or females. Under anthropogenic pressure, selection on early horn growth of culled individuals showed diametrically opposed sex-biased patterns, depending on the culling regime and hunters' preferences. Despite the selective bias between males and females in one of the hunted populations, we did not detect significant sex-specific differences in the long-term pattern of early growth. The relationship between early horn growth and natural survival in either sex might suggest stabilizing selection on horn size in chamois. Selection through culling can be strongly sex-biased also in weakly dimorphic species, depending on hunters' preferences and hunting regulations, and long-term data are needed to reveal potential undesirable evolutionary consequences.

J	Lassis, R; Festa-Bianchet, M; Pelletier, F				Lassis, Roxane; Festa-Bianchet, Marco; Pelletier, Fanie			Effects of hunting pressure and timing of harvest on bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) horn size	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Trophy hunting can affect weapon size of wild animals through both demographic and evolutionary changes. In bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis Shaw, 1804), intense harvest of young males with fast-growing horns may have partly driven long-term decreases in horn size. These selective effects could be dampened if migrants from protected areas, not subject to artificial selection, survived and reproduced within hunted populations. Bighorn rams undertake long-distance breeding migrations in the weeks preceding the late-November rut. We analysed records of >7800 trophy bighorn rams shot from 1974 to 2019 in Alberta, Canada, to test the hypothesis that high harvest pressure during breeding migrations was correlated with a greater decrease in horn size. We compared areas with and without a pronounced harvest peak in late October, when male breeding migrations begin. Areas without a pronounced harvest peak in late October, which likely experienced a lower harvest rate, showed a similar temporal decline in horn size, but no increase in age at harvest suggesting a possibly weaker decline in horn growth. Our study suggests that unselected immigrants from protected areas could partly buffer the effects of intense trophy hunting only if harvest pressure was reduced when breeding migrations commence.

ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Human harvests can unwittingly drive evolution on morphology and life history, and these selective effects may be detrimental to the management of natural resources. Although theory suggests that harvest refuges, as sources of unselected animals, could buffer the effects of human exploitation on wild populations, few studies have assessed their efficiency. We analyzed records from >7000 trophy bighorn rams (Ovis canadensis) harvested in Alberta, Canada, between 1974 and 2011 to investigate if the movement of rams from refuges toward harvested areas reduced the effects of selective harvesting on horn size through phenotypic rescue. Rams taken near refuges had horns on average about 3% longer than rams shot far from refuges and were slightly older, suggesting migration from refuges into hunted areas. Rams from areas adjacent to and far from harvest refuges, however, showed similar declines in horn length and increases in age at harvest over time, indicating a decreasing rate of horn growth. Our study suggests that the influx of rams from refuges is not sufficient to mitigate the selective effects of sheep trophy harvest. Instead, we suggest that selective hunting of highly mobile animals may affect the genetic structure of populations that spend part of the year inside protected areas.					; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/AER-0364-2022	Pelletier, Fanie/0000-0002-0113-5412; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/0000-0002-2352-3379													2045-7758					SEP	2014	4	17					3375	3382		10.1002/ece3.1185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1185								25535554					WOS:000342846300006

Terry			Effects of harvest, culture, and climate on trends in size of horn-like structures in trophy ungulates	WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS												Hunting remains the cornerstone of the North American model of wildlife conservation and management. Nevertheless, research has indicated the potential for hunting to adversely influence size of horn-like structures of some ungulates. In polygynous ungulates, mating success of males is strongly correlated with body size and size of horn-like structures; consequently, sexual selection has favored the development of large horns and antlers. Horn-like structures are biologically important and are of great cultural interest, both of which highlight the need to identify long-term trends in size of those structures, and understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for such trends. We evaluated trends in horn and antler size of trophy males (individuals exhibiting exceptionally large horns or antlers) recorded from 1900 to 2008 in Records of North American Big Game, which comprised >22,000 records among 25 trophy categories encompassing the geographic extent of species occupying North America. The long-term and broad-scale nature of those data neutralized localized effects of climate and population dynamics, making it possible to detect meaningful changes in size of horn-like structures among trophy males over the past century; however, ages of individual specimens were not available, which prevented us from evaluating age-class specific changes in size. Therefore, we used a weight-of-evidence approach based on differences among trophy categories in life-history characteristics, geographic distribution, morphological attributes, and harvest regimes to discriminate among competing hypotheses for explaining long-term trends in horn and antler size of trophy ungulates, and provide directions for future research. These hypotheses were young male age structure caused by intensive harvest of males (H1), genetic change as a result of selective male harvest (H2), a sociological effect (H3), effects of climate (H4), and habitat alteration (H5). Although the number of entries per decade has increased for most trophy categories, trends in size of horn-like structures were negative and significant for 11 of 17 antlered categories and 3 of 8 horned categories. Mean predicted declines during 19502008 were 1.87% and 0.68% for categories of trophy antlers and horns, respectively. Our results were not consistent with a sociological effect (H3), nutritional limitation imposed by climate (H4), or habitat alteration (H5) as potential explanations for long-term trends in size of trophies. In contrast, our results were consistent with a harvest-based explanation. Two of the 3 species that experienced the most conservative harvest regimes in North America (i.e., bighorn sheep [Ovis canadensis] and bison [Bison bison]) did not exhibit a significant, long-term trend in horn size. In addition, horn size of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), which are capable of attaining peak horn size by 23 years of age, increased significantly over the past century. Both of those results provide support for the intensive-harvest hypothesis, which predicts that harvest of males has gradually shifted age structure towards younger, and thus smaller, males. The absence of a significant trend for mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), which are difficult to accurately judge size of horns in the field, provided some support for the selective-harvest hypothesis. One other prediction that followed from the selective-harvest hypothesis was not supported; horned game were not more susceptible to reductions in size. A harvest-induced reduction in age structure can increase the number of males that are harvested prior to attaining peak horn or antler size, whereas genetic change imposed by selective harvest may be less likely to occur in free-ranging populations when other factors, such as age and nutrition, can override genetic potential for size. Long-term trends in the size of trophy horn-like structures provide the incentive to evaluate the appropriateness of the current harvest paradigm, wherein harvest is focused largely on males; although the lack of information on age of specimens prevented us from rigorously differentiating among causal mechanisms. Disentangling potential mechanisms underpinning long-term trends in horn and antler size is a daunting task, but one that is worthy of additional research focused on elucidating the relative influence of nutrition and effects (both demographic and genetic) of harvest.

J	Schindler, S; Festa-Bianchet, M; Hogg, JT; Pelletier, F				Schindler, Susanne; Festa-Bianchet, Marco; Hogg, John T.; Pelletier, Fanie			Hunting, Age Structure, and Horn Size Distribution in Bighorn Sheep	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Trophy hunting, the selective removal of animals for human recreation, can contribute to conservation when appropriately managed. Yet, little is known about how harvest rates or different definitions of trophy affect age structure and trophy size in harvested animals and in survivors because no controlled studies exist. To investigate the impacts of different management regimes, we developed an individual-based model for bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), based on empirical data on survival from a protected population and data on horn growth from 2 populations that differed in their growth rates. One population showed slow horn growth and the other population fast horn growth. We subjected these model populations to varying harvest rates and 2 different hunting regulations: 4/5 curl and full-curl definitions of a trophy male. We found that the effect of hunting regulations depends on horn growth rate. In populations with fast horn growth, the effects of trophy hunting on male age structure and horn size were greater and the effect of a change in the definition of legal male smaller than in populations with slow growth rates. High harvest rates led to a younger age structure and smaller horn size. Both effects were weakened by a more restrictive definition of trophy male. As harvest rates increased past 40% of legal males, the number of males harvested increased only marginally because an increasing proportion of the harvested males included those that had just become legal. Although our simulation focused on bighorn sheep, the link between horn growth rate and harvest effects may be applicable for any size-selective harvest regime.

In Poland, following a demographic collapse in the 1990s and the introduction of a hunting ban in 2001, the population of moose (Alces alces) has increased from 1,800 to over 20,000 individuals, recolonising its former range. As the moose is a charismatic species and a popular subject for nature photography, we analysed changes in antler size and shape in this cervid between 2005 and 2021 based on photos of male moose and antler casts provided by photographers or available in social media. Our findings indicate that during the hunting ban, the probability of observing the cervina antler type significantly decreased over time, from 47% in 2012 to 28% in 2021. Meanwhile, the probability of observing the intermediate and palmate antler types significantly increased from 44 to 53% and from 9 to 19%, respectively. The mean number of tines significantly increased from 3.2 in 2005 to 4.7 in 2021, and the antler size index significantly increased from 3.4 to 3.9. The most likely mechanism behind the observed changes could be the ageing of a population released from hunting pressure. We also observed regional variation in antler size, which is likely related to differences in environmental conditions. Our study serves as an example of how passive citizen science can contribute to our understanding of ecological trends and the quantification of population patterns. It also has important implications for management of species affected by trophy hunting.

The extent to which harvesting is selective for specific traits is important in order to understand contemporary evolutionary processes. In addition, since such data are frequently used in life-history studies, it is important to know the pattern of selectivity as a source of bias. Recently, it was demonstrated that different hunting methods were selected for different weights in red deer (Cervus elaphus), but little insight was offered into why this occurs. In this study, we show that foreign trophy stalkers select for larger antlers when hunting roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) than local hunters, but that close to half of the difference in selectivity was due to foreigners hunting earlier in the season and in locations with larger males. The relationship between antler size and age was nevertheless fairly similar based on whether deer was shot by foreign or local hunters.

In this study, we investigated the effects of population density, environmental covariates and trophy hunting on horn development in a population of European mouflon Ovis aries musimon introduced to the Mediterranean region of Croatia in the early 1980s. The study population was subject to commercial trophy hunting on males since the mid-1980s. This allowed to analyse the temporal trend in early horn growth in 341 rams legally culled. Cohort-based linear model and analysis of deviance (ANODEV) revealed a significant negative trend in early horn growth, with a decline of ca. 10% over only 15 cohorts (1993-2007). The increase in population density (by ca. 600%) and summer temperature, selected via LASSO regression, explained about 61% and 13% of the decline in early horn growth, as revealed by the ANODEV R-2. Our results suggest a prominent role of food-limiting factors in the decline of weapon size. We also found a negative relationship between age at death and early horn growth in our study population, which suggests the occurrence of hunters' selectivity towards large horns. The effect of trophy hunting on the decline in horn size, however, is difficult to quantify. Our analysis was largely influenced by the rapid increase of mouflon density after introduction, thereby limiting the possibility to detect potential effects of hunting selection, although the large number of rams shot before 5 years of age may possibly lead to undesirable consequences of trophy hunting on mating success. To clarify the consequences of commercial trophy hunting on the mouflon population, the long-term pattern of horn growth and the age-dependent male siring success should be further investigated.

J	Waltert, M; Meyer, B; Kiffner, C				Waltert, Matthias; Meyer, Britta; Kiffner, Christian			Habitat availability, hunting or poaching: what affects distribution and density of large mammals in western Tanzanian woodlands?	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Game reserves (GR) in Tanzania have been found to support similar or lower densities of large mammals compared with National parks (NP). But as these areas usually differ considerably not only in regard to management but also to environmental factors, we assessed the relative importance of vegetation cover, species-specific habitat preferences and legal (trophy hunting) and illegal off-take for observed differences in species-specific densities. In the Katavi ecosystem, open habitats were characteristic elements of Katavi NP, while Rukwa GR was dominated by miombo forest. In an inter-specific comparison, density differences were moderately correlated with preferences for open habitats, and with estimates of combined legal and illegal off-take but not with one of these separately. In a multiple linear regression, open habitat preference was found to explain 39.6% of the density differences between the two protected areas. This analysis suggests that the broad-scale pattern of most species' distributions is governed by differing vegetation cover but that several species are overexploited by illegal (elephant, giraffe, buffalo, bush pig, warthog) or combined off-take (hippopotamus, eland, waterbuck), thus emphasizing the need for quota readjustments and a more efficient anti-poaching control.

J	Hedrick, PW				Hedrick, Philip W.			Rapid Decrease in Horn Size of Bighorn Sheep: Environmental Decline, Inbreeding Depression, or Evolutionary Response to Trophy Hunting?	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY												There are numerous examples demonstrating that selection has greatly influenced phenotypes in wild-harvested species. Here, a significant reduction in horn size in trophy desert bighorn sheep rams over 30 years in a reintroduced population in Aravaipa Canyon, Arizona is documented. After examining the potential effects of a detrimental change in the environment, inbreeding depression, and hunter-caused evolutionary change, it appears that environmental deterioration, apparently from the effects of drought, may be a major cause of the decline in horn size. In particular, the reduction in ram horn size is positively associated with reduced winter lifetime rainfall over the 3 decades. Over the same period, the demographic indicator lamb-to-ewe ratio has also declined in the Aravaipa population. On the other hand, lamb-to-ewe ratio has not declined statewide in Arizona, and the population size in Aravaipa appears to be increasing, suggesting local- and trait-specific effects. Using a theoretical context, neither inbreeding depression nor hunter selection by themselves appear to the sole causes of the lower horn size. However, some combination of environmental factors, inbreeding depression, and hunter selection may have caused the decrease in observed horn size. It is not clear what management actions might be successful in countering the environmental effects on horn size, but supplemental feeding and cattle removal are suggested while translocation is suggested to counter the effects of inbreeding depression and reduced hunting and translocation are suggested to counter the effects of hunter selection.																			0022-1503	1465-7333				NOV-DEC	2011	102	6					770	781		10.1093/jhered/esr082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esr082								21900210					WOS:000296100900015

A test using game bird capture-dead recoveries	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Selective hunting has various impacts that need to be considered for the conservation and management of harvested populations. The consequences of selective harvest have mostly been studied in trophy hunting and fishing, where selection of specific phenotypes is intentional. Recent studies, however, show that selection can also occur unintentionally. With at least 52 million birds harvested each year in Europe, it is particularly relevant to evaluate the selectivity of hunting on this taxon. Here, we considered 211,806 individuals belonging to 7 hunted bird species to study unintentional selectivity in harvest. Using linear mixed models, we compared morphological traits (mass, wing, and tarsus size) and body condition at the time of banding between birds that were subsequently recovered from hunting during the same year as their banding, and birds that were not recovered. We did not find any patterns showing systematic differences between recovery categories, among our model species, for the traits we studied. Moreover, when a difference existed between recovery categories, it was so small that its biological relevance can be challenged. Hunting of birds in Europe therefore does not show any form of strong selectivity on the morphological and physiological traits that we studied and should hence not lead to any change of these traits either by plastic or by evolutionary response.

Hunter selection for larger and older male bobcats affects annual harvest demography	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												Wildlife researchers often rely on demographic data collected from harvested animals to estimate population dynamics. But demographic data from harvested animals may be nonrepresentative if hunters/trappers have the ability and motivation to preferentially select for certain physical traits. Hunter preference is well demonstrated for ungulates, but less so for other wildlife species such as furbearers. We used data from bobcats harvested in Wisconsin (1983-2014) to determine if harvest method and demographics (mass, male:female sex ratio and age) have changed over time, and if bobcat hunters/trappers exhibited selection. Each trait of harvested bobcats that we tested changed over time, and because these selected traits were interrelated, we inferred that harvest selection for larger size biased harvests in favour of older, male bobcats. The selection of older, male bobcats appears primarily driven by hound hunters (hereafter hunters) compared to trappers, with hunters more frequently creating taxidermy mounts from their harvested bobcats. We found an increase in the proportion of bobcats that were harvested by hunting compared to trapping over time, and this was associated with increased selectivity and substantial changes in the characteristics of harvested bobcats. Selection by hunters may bias population models that are based on the demography of harvested bobcats, and accounting for biases that may occur, including from different harvest methods, is critical when using harvest-dependent data.					; Allen, Maximilian/ABG-9307-2020; VANDEELEN, TIMOTHY/KWU-1140-2024	Roberts, Nathan/0000-0001-6965-9637; Allen, Maximilian/0000-0001-8976-889X; 													2054-5703					OCT	2018	5	10							180668	10.1098/rsos.180668	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.180668								30473820					WOS:000451073300026

Estimating population size and habitat suitability for mountain nyala in areas with different protection status	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												Many species of large herbivores are declining in numbers as a consequence of direct exploitation or habitat loss. In the Ethiopian highlands, rapid human population growth has resulted in an expansion of human settlements and farmland, threatening many endemic species such as the mountain nyala Tragelaphus buxtoni. Despite being listed as an endangered species, the mountain nyala is still the most important trophy hunting species in Ethiopia. We counted faecal pellets of mountain nyala within plots distributed along transects to estimate population size and identify key environmental variables associated with the presence of faecal pellet groups. The total mountain nyala population was estimated at 3756 (95% confidence intervals: 2506-7135) individuals, mainly occupying woodlands while avoiding human developments (agriculture and settlements). The total suitable area was estimated at 8333km(2). Only 31.6% of the total population lived within a national park, while 53.5% of the population inhabited two controlled hunting areas in the eastern mountains. Abundance was 3.7 times higher in areas patrolled by wardens, regardless of being in a national park or hunting area, suggesting that formal protection must be followed by surveillance to avoid poaching and habitat destruction. We found no negative correlation between pellet abundance and trophy hunting. Yet, it is too early to conclude that trophy hunting is sustainable as it has only recently been initiated in the studied populations.

J	Mysterud, A				Mysterud, Atle			Selective harvesting of large mammals: how often does it result in directional selection?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Harvesting of large mammals is usually not random, and directional selection has been identified as the main cause of rapid evolution. However, selective harvesting in meat and recreational hunting cultures does not automatically imply directional selection for trait size. 2. Harvesting selectivity is more than a matter of hunter preference. Selection is influenced by management regulations, hunting methods, animal trait variance, behaviour and abundance. Most studies of hunter selection only report age-or sex-specific selection, or differences in trait size selection among hunting methods or groups of hunters, rather than trait size relative to the age-specific means required for directional selection. 3. Synthesis and applications. Managers aiming to avoid rapid evolution should not only consider directional selection and trophy hunting but also mitigate other important evolutionary forces such as harvesting intensity per se, and sexual selection processes that are affected by skewed sex ratios and age structures.

We examined habitat selection and diet of the dholes by searching for dholes in the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve (DHR), the only hunting reserve in Nepal, and developed a habitat selection model to determine their habitat preferences. We also collected anecdotal data on depredation events and attitudes toward the dholes from 89 local people. We collected each dhole scat encountered and conducted dietary analysis to calculate the percent frequency of occurrence of each prey item and to estimate the biomass consumed by dholes in the study area. The dholes used most habitat types and targeted a wide range of prey species and sizes, but avoided barren land, Juniperus spp.-and Abies spp.-dominated forests, and habitat under anthropogenic pressure. Eighty percent of the dhole's diet was represented by wild prey species; blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) comprised 13.9% and livestock comprised 20% of the diet. The consumption of livestock has led to a negative attitude of local people toward dhole conservation. As blue sheep are the main trophy hunting species of the DHR, there is also the potential for competition between hunters and dhole, and other predators, for blue sheep. Our habitat selection model will be useful for estimating the probability of occurrence of this species within similar regions. These findings provide baseline information for authorities responsible for preparing conservation action plans for this species and managing the co-existence of humans and dholes within the reserve.

However, despite continual year-round hunting of bison in some populations, little is known about how the behavior of survivors may be altered. Therefore, in this initial study, we used focal-animal observations in adjacent populations of continually hunted and protected Plains bison (Bisonbisonbison) in western South Dakota, to examine the potential impact of hunting on bellowing rate-an important behavior that serves to intimidate rival bulls and potentially influences mate choice by females. In addition to hunting, we investigated how the number of attendant males, number of adult females, group size, and number of days from the start of rut influenced bellowing rate. Bulls bellowed an order of magnitude more often in the protected population than in the hunted populations, whereas bellowing rate was not significantly different in the hunted populations. Hunting was significantly and negatively associated with bellowing rate, while all other predictors were found to be positively associated with bellowing rate. Furthermore, the impact of hunting on bellowing rate became more pronounced (i.e., dampened bellowing rate more strongly) as the number of attendant males increased. Changes in bellowing behavior of bulls (and possibly mate choice by cows) can alter breeding opportunities. Therefore, our data suggest the need for studies with broader-scale geographical and temporal replication to determine the extent that continual year-round hunting has on bellowing rate of bison during the rut. If reduced bellowing is associated with human hunting on a larger scale, then wildlife managers may need to adjust hunting rate and duration, timing (season), and the time lag between hunting events in order to insure that bison are able to express their full repertoire of natural mating behaviors.																			2167-8359					APR 6	2017	5								e3153	10.7717/peerj.3153	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3153								28396826					WOS:000398662600004

Most researchers using such data assume that their data represents a random sample of a particular demographic class. However, hunters typically select a non-random subset of the population and hunting is, therefore, not a random process. Here, with red deer (Cervus elaphus) hunting data from a ranch in Toledo, Spain, we demonstrate that data collection methods have a significant influence upon the apparent relationship between age and weight. We argue that a failure to correct for such methodological bias may have significant consequences for the interpretation of analyses involving weight or correlated traits such as breeding success, and urge researchers to explore methods to identify and correct for such bias in their data.

Effects of hunting on genetic diversity, inbreeding and dispersal in Finnish black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix)	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Intensive hunting activities such as commercial fishing and trophy hunting can have profound influences on natural populations. However, less intensive recreational hunting can also have subtle effects on animal behaviour, habitat use and movement, with implications for population persistence. Lekking species such as the black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix) may be especially prone to hunting as leks are temporally and spatially predictable, making them easy targets. Furthermore, inbreeding in black grouse is mainly avoided through female-biased dispersal, so any disruptions to dispersal caused by hunting could lead to changes in gene flow, increasing the risk of inbreeding. We therefore investigated the impact of hunting on genetic diversity, inbreeding and dispersal on a metapopulation of black grouse in Central Finland. We genotyped 1065 adult males and 813 adult females from twelve lekking sites (six hunted, six unhunted) and 200 unrelated chicks from seven sites (two hunted, five unhunted) at up to thirteen microsatellite loci. Our initial confirmatory analysis of sex-specific fine-scale population structure revealed little genetic structure in the metapopulation. Levels of inbreeding did not differ significantly between hunted and unhunted sites in neither adults nor chicks. However, immigration rates into hunted sites were significantly higher among adults compared to immigration into unhunted sites. We conclude that the influx of migrants into hunted sites may compensate for the loss of harvested individuals, thereby increasing gene flow and mitigating inbreeding. Given the absence of any obvious barriers to gene flow in Central Finland, a spatially heterogeneous matrix of hunted and unhunted regions may be crucial to ensure sustainable harvests into the future.					van Oers, Kees/B-2562-2009; Lebigre, Christophe/JAC-8468-2023; Soulsbury, Carl/F-3137-2010; Hoffman, Joseph/K-7725-2012; Chen, Rebecca Shuhua/KBB-0523-2024	van Oers, Kees/0000-0001-6984-906X; Lebigre, Christophe/0000-0001-6119-2534; Soulsbury, Carl/0000-0001-8808-5210; Hoffman, Joseph/0000-0001-5895-8949; Chen, Rebecca Shuhua/0000-0002-9364-3771													1752-4571					MAR	2023	16	3					625	637		10.1111/eva.13521	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.13521		DEC 2022						36969146					WOS:000903890800001

If the targeted character is heritable, then there will be an evolutionary response to selection, and where the trait is not, then any response will be plastic or demographic. Identifying the relative contributions of these different mechanisms is a major challenge in wildlife conservation. New mathematical approaches can provide insight not previously available. Here we develop a size- and age-based two-sex integral projection model based on individual-based data from a long-term study of hunted bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) at Ram Mountain, Canada. We simulate the effect of trophy hunting on body size and find that the inheritance of body mass is weak and that any perceived decline in body mass of the bighorn population is largely attributable to demographic change and environmental factors. To our knowledge, this work provides the first use of two-sex integral projection models to investigate the potential eco-evolutionary consequences of selective harvest.

Data from selective harvests underestimate temporal trends in quantitative traits	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Human harvests can select against phenotypes favoured by natural selection, and natural resource managers should evaluate possible artificial selection on wild populations. Because the required genetic data are extremely difficult to gather, however, managers typically rely on harvested animals to document temporal trends. It is usually unknown whether these data are unbiased. We explore our ability to detect a decline in horn size of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) by comparing harvested males with all males in a population where evolutionary changes owing to trophy hunting were previously reported. Hunting records underestimated the temporal decline, partly because of an increasing proportion of rams that could not be harvested because their horns were smaller than the threshold set by hunting regulations. If harvests are selective, temporal trends measured from harvest records will underestimate the magnitude of changes in wild populations.

We analyze 39 years of phenotypic data on horn size in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) subject to intense trophy hunting for 23 years, after which harvests nearly ceased. Our analyses revealed a significant decline in genetic value for horn length of rams, consistent with an evolutionary response to artificial selection on this trait. The probability that the observed change in male horn length was due solely to drift is 9.9%. Female horn length and male horn base, traits genetically correlated to the trait under selection, showed weak declining trends. There was no temporal trend in genetic value for female horn base circumference, a trait not directly targeted by selective hunting and not genetically correlated with male horn length. The decline in genetic value for male horn length stopped, but was not reversed, when hunting pressure was drastically reduced. Our analysis provides support for the contention that selective hunting led to a reduction in horn length through evolutionary change. It also confirms that after artificial selection stops, recovery through natural selection is slow.

J	Knell, RJ; Martínez-Ruiz, C				Knell, Robert J.; Martinez-Ruiz, Carlos			Selective harvest focused on sexual signal traits can lead to extinction under directional environmental change	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Humans commonly harvest animals based on their expression of secondary sexual traits such as horns or antlers. This selective harvest is thought to have little effect on harvested populations because offtake rates are low and usually only the males are targeted. These arguments do not, however, take the relationship between secondary sexual trait expression and animal condition into account: there is increasing evidence that in many cases the degree of expression of such traits is correlated with an animal's overall well-being, which is partly determined by their genetic match to the environment. Using an individual-based model, we find that when there is directional environmental change, selective harvest of males with the largest secondary sexual traits can lead to extinction in otherwise resilient populations. When harvest is not selective, the males best suited to a new environment gain the majority of matings and beneficial alleles spread rapidly. When these best-adapted males are removed, however, their beneficial alleles are lost, leading to extinction. Given the current changes happening globally, these results suggest that trophy hunting and other cases of selective harvest (such as certain types of insect collection) should be managed with extreme care whenever populations are faced with changing conditions.

J	Hengeveld, PE; Festa-Bianchet, M				Hengeveld, Pamela E.; Festa-Bianchet, Marco			Harvest Regulations and Artificial Selection on Horn Size in Male Bighorn Sheep	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Wild sheep in North America are highly prized by hunters and most harvest regulations restrict legal harvest to males with a specified minimum horn curl. Because reproductive success is skewed toward larger males that are socially dominant, these regulations may select against high-quality, fast-growing males. To evaluate potential selective effects of alternative management strategies, we analyzed horn increment measures of males harvested over 28 yr (1975-2003) in 2 bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) ecotypes in British Columbia, Canada. Using mixed-effect models we examined variation in hunter selection for horn size, early horn growth, and male age under different harvest regulations (Full Curl, Three Quarter Curl, Any Ram). Under all regulations, males with the greatest early horn growth were harvested at the youngest ages, before the age at which large horns influence reproductive success. Early growth decreased with harvest age and until >7 yr of age it was greatest in males harvested under Full Curl regulation. Permit type (General vs. Limited Entry Hunt) and hunter origin (British Columbia Resident vs. Non-Resident) had little effect on horn size of harvested males. Full Curl regulations increased the average age of harvested males by <1 yr relative to Three-Quarter Curl regulations. Age-specific horn measures in the California ecotype harvested under Three-Quarter Curl regulations declined over time but we observed no temporal declines in the Rocky Mountain ecotype, primarily harvested under Full Curl regulations. Management strategies that protect some males with greater early horn growth or provide harvest refuges to maintain genetic diversity are likely to reduce potential for negative effects of artificial selection.

J	Lassis, R; Festa-Bianchet, M; Pelletier, F				Lassis, Roxane; Festa-Bianchet, Marco; Pelletier, Fanie			Breeding migrations by bighorn sheep males are driven by mating opportunities	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												In some species where male mating success largely depends on intrasexual competition, males can adopt migratory or resident strategies to seek breeding opportunities. The resulting mixture of resident and migrant tactics within a population can have important ecological, genetic, and evolutionary consequences for metapopulations. Bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis males establish a linear dominance hierarchy that influences their mating tactics. Some males perform breeding migrations during the pre-rut and rut to seek mating opportunities, but little is known about these seasonal movements. We analyzed presence/absence data for 62 marked bighorn males during six mating seasons (20-32 males/year) in the Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada, where hunting was not allowed. On average, about half of males left their natal population to rut elsewhere. The proportion of males leaving (yearly range 15%-69%) increased as the number of resident mature males increased and the populational sex ratio decreased, with fewer females during the pre-rut. Among those leaving the park, 24% did so in October, while the trophy sheep hunting season was open. Detailed monitoring of breeding migrations in protected populations could inform management strategies to limit evolutionary impacts of hunting, which can alter size-dependent mortality and create artificial pressures driving changes on heritable traits.					; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/AER-0364-2022	Pelletier, Fanie/0000-0002-0113-5412; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/0000-0002-2352-3379													2045-7758					MAR	2022	12	3							e8692	10.1002/ece3.8692	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8692								35342589					WOS:000774702000001

Habitat use of and threats to African large carnivores in a mixed-use landscape	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Large carnivores increasingly inhabit human-affected landscapes, which exhibit heterogeneity in biotic resources, anthropogenic pressures, and management strategies. Understanding large carnivore habitat use in these systems is critical for their conservation, as is the evaluation of competing management approaches and the impacts of significant land-use changes. We used occupancy modeling to investigate habitat use of an intact eastern African large carnivore guild across the 45,000 km(2) Ruaha-Rungwa landscape in south-central Tanzania. We determined the relative impact on five large carnivore species of biotic, anthropogenic, and management factors at the scales of home range selection and short-term use within home ranges. We also specifically tested the effect of abandonment of trophy hunting areas on large carnivore occurrence. Patterns of habitat use differed among species. Lions (Panthera leo) appeared affected by top-down limitation, as their occurrence was significantly negatively associated with illegal human activity (beta = -0.63 [SE 0.28]). African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), instead, were limited by biotic features; the species was negatively associated with riverine areas of high sympatric predator density (beta = -1.00 [SE 0.43]) and used less-productive habitats. Spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) and leopard (Panthera Pardus) persisted in more disturbed areas and across habitat types. Large carnivore occurrence was not affected by whether an area was used for photographic or trophy hunting tourism; regular law enforcement was instead a better predictor of occurrence. All species fared better in actively managed hunting areas than those that had been abandoned by operators. Overall, our findings highlight the divergent habitat requirements within large carnivore guilds and the importance of adopting an integrated approach to large carnivore conservation planning in modern systems. We also identified a novel threat to African conservation areas in the form of decreased management investments associated with the abandonment of trophy hunting areas.

Understanding the mechanisms favoring genetic rescue through migration could help ensure evolutionarily sustainable harvest outside protected areas and conserve genetic diversity inside those areas. We developed a stochastic individual-based metapopulation model to evaluate the potential for migration from protected areas to mitigate the evolutionary consequences of selective harvest. We parameterized the model with detailed data from individual monitoring of two populations of bighorn sheep subjected to trophy hunting. We tracked horn length through time in a large protected and a trophy-hunted populations connected through male breeding migrations. We quantified and compared declines in horn length and rescue potential under various combinations of migration rate, hunting rate in hunted areas and temporal overlap in timing of harvest and migrations, which affects the migrants' survival and chances to breed within exploited areas. Our simulations suggest that the effects of size-selective harvest on male horn length in hunted populations can be dampened or avoided if harvest pressure is low, migration rate is substantial, and migrants leaving protected areas have a low risk of being shot. Intense size-selective harvest impacts the phenotypic and genetic diversity in horn length, and population structure through changes in proportions of large-horned males, sex ratio and age structure. When hunting pressure is high and overlaps with male migrations, effects of selective removal also emerge in the protected population, so that instead of a genetic rescue of hunted populations, our model predicts undesirable effects inside protected areas. Our results stress the importance of a landscape approach to management, to promote genetic rescue from protected areas and limit ecological and evolutionary impacts of harvest on both harvested and protected populations.					; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/AER-0364-2022	Pelletier, Fanie/0000-0002-0113-5412; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/0000-0002-2352-3379; Van de Walle, Joanie/0000-0002-5137-1851													1752-4571					JUN	2023	16	6					1105	1118		10.1111/eva.13554	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.13554		MAY 2023						37360026					WOS:000986869300001

In addition to the most widespread hunting system in Spain for Iberian red deer stags (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) called monteria, there are also selective monterias aimed at culling poor-trophy males in order to improve the average quality of the trophies for commercial hunt. This way of removing poor-trophy males contrasts with the most common procedure of shooting individual males by selective stalking that is used in other areas of Europe. Also, due to the hunting procedure by which most deer are shot while running chased by dogs, it is doubtful whether hunters are actually producing a selective impact on deer populations. In this paper, we compare data of males shot in commercial monteria and in selective monteria in Southern Spain. We found that males in selective monteria were smaller in body size and in antler size than in commercial hunts, even correcting by age, although the selective effect was stronger at some ages. We discuss the implications of this practice for sustainable use and conservation.

J	Gigliotti, LM; Metcalf, EC				Gigliotti, Larry M.; Metcalf, Elizabeth Covelli			Motivations of Female Black Hills Deer Hunters	HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE												State fish and wildlife agencies are particularly interested in attracting female participation because of the potential to offset declining participation in hunting. Understanding female hunters' motivations will be critical for designing effective recruitment and retention programs for women hunters. Although female participation in hunting is increasing, males still outnumber females by about tenfold. Gender differences in deer hunters were explored by comparing ratings of eight motivations (social, nature, excitement, meat, challenge, trophy, extra hunting opportunity, and solitude). Hunter types were defined by hunters' selection of the most important motivation for why they like Black Hills deer hunting. Overall, females and males were relatively similar in their ratings of the eight motivations, and we found 85% gender similarity in the selection of the most important motivation. Women were slightly more motivated by the food aspect of the hunt while men placed slightly more value on the hunt as a sporting activity.

The landscape of anthropogenic mortality: how African lions respond to spatial variation in risk	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Demography and conservation status of many wild organisms are increasingly shaped by interactions with humans. This is particularly the case for large, wide-ranging carnivores. 2. Using 206 mortality records (1999-2012) of lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we calculated mortality rates for each source of anthropogenic mortality, modelled risk of anthropogenic mortality across the landscape accounting for time lions spent in different parts of the landscape, and assessed whether subsets of the population were more at risk. 3. Anthropogenic activities caused 88% of male and 67% of female mortalities; male mortality being dominated by trophy hunting while the sources for female mortality were more varied (bycatch snaring, retaliatory killing, hunting). 4. Landscapes of anthropogenic mortality risk revealed that communal subsistence farming areas, characterized by high risk (due to retaliatory killing) but avoided by lions, are population sinks. Trophy hunting areas and areas within protected areas bordering communal farmland, where bushmeat snaring is prevalent, form 'ecological traps' (or 'attractive sinks'). 5. Lions avoided risky areas, suggesting they may make behavioural decisions based on perceptions of risk. Experienced adults used risky areas less and incorporated lower proportions of them in their home ranges than young individuals, suggesting that the latter may either be naive or forced into peripheral habitats. 6. Synthesis and applications. This paper contributes to an understanding of how large carnivore populations are affected by anthropogenic mortality across the conservation landscape. This is critical to designing focussed, appropriate and cost-effective conservation management strategies. Agricultural areas are intuitively identified by conservationists as being risky for carnivores due to retaliatory killing, with threats largely mitigated against by improving livestock protection. However, parts of protected areas may also form less easily identified 'attractive sinks' for carnivores. In particular, trophy hunting areas adjacent to national parks need careful management to avoid damaging effects of overhunting. Law enforcement is needed to reduce the effects of bushmeat poaching on predators and other wildlife in protected areas. To be most effective, resource-limited antipoaching activities should prioritize wildlife-rich areas close to human settlement as these tend to be hot spots for bushmeat poaching.

J	Nilsen, EB; Solberg, EJ				Nilsen, Erlend B.; Solberg, Erling J.			Patterns of hunting mortality in Norwegian moose (Alces alces) populations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												We used a simple life table approach to examine the age-specific patterns of harvest mortality in eight Norwegian moose populations during the last 15 years and tried to determine if the observed patterns were caused by hunter selectivity. The general opinion among local managers is that hunters prefer to shoot female moose not in company with calves to keep a high number of reproductive females in the population (and because of the emotional stress involved in leaving the calf/calves without a mother), and relatively large males because of the higher return with respect to meat and trophy. In support of the former view, we found the harvest mortality of adult females to be higher among pre-prime (1-3 years old) than prime-aged age classes (4-7 years old). This is probably because prime-aged females are more fecund and, therefore, more likely to be in company with one or two calves during the hunting season. As the season progressed, however, the selection pressure on barren females decreased, probably due to more productive females becoming 'legal' prey as their calf/calves were harvested. In males, we did not find any evidence of strong age-specific hunter selectivity, despite strong age-dependent variation in body mass and antler size. We suggest that this was due to the current strongly female-biased sex ratio in most Norwegian moose populations, which leaves the hunters with few opportunities to be selective within a relatively short and intensive hunting season. The management implications of these findings and to what extent the results are likely to affect the future evolution of life histories in Norwegian moose populations are discussed.

J	Bro-Jorgensen, J				Bro-Jorgensen, J.			Will their armaments be their downfall? Large horn size increases extinction risk in bovids	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												Clarifying the emergent fitness associated with sexually selected traits under the current, increasingly anthropogenic selection regimes is important to understand ongoing evolutionary changes in nature and inform the conservation management of endangered species. Several reasons exist why sexual selection may affect extinction risk. Increased risk may result either from inherent trade-offs between sexually selected traits and viability traits or from selective hunting of sexually selected species. Reduced risk is also possible, for instance if the preference for high-performing mates characteristic of sexually selected species has beneficial genetic consequences for the population. Here, I show that the threat level of bovid species increases with large male horn size. This is the first time, to my knowledge, that sexually selected weaponry has been shown to increase extinction risk at the interspecific level. However, threat level was unrelated to another trait under sexual selection, sexual body size dimorphism, indicating that the effect of sexual selection on extinction risk depends on trait-specific interactions with extrinsic factors. The results suggest that the higher threat level of long-horned species is not primarily due to current trophy hunting practices and rather point to environmentally induced viability costs as a possible main driver. Still, the fact that long-horned species are known to be preferred by trophy hunters highlights the importance of continuously monitoring trophy hunting practices to assure their long-term sustainability.																			1367-9430	1469-1795				FEB	2014	17	1					80	87		10.1111/acv.12062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acv.12062													WOS:000329762100011

Effects of male targeted harvest regime on sexual segregation in mountain lion	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Male targeted harvest regimes of carnivores are now widely accepted to result in increased sexually selected infanticide (SSI). Male targeted harvest regimes of males should therefore result in increased sexually segregated habitat use in infanticidal carnivores. We tested the effects of low and high levels of male hunting mortality and associated SSI on sexually segregated habitat use in mountain lions. The "no effect of hunting" hypothesis predicts that no sexual segregation would occur or that all female mountain lions would segregate from males because of sexual dimorphism. The "hunting effect" hypothesis predicts that females with kittens would segregate from younger immigrant males in the heavily hunted population during summer when kittens are vulnerable to SSI. We rejected the "no effect" hypothesis and accepted the "hunting effect" hypothesis for mountain lions. Females with kittens avoided immigrant males in the heavily hunted population during summer others did not. This sexual segregation corresponded with females with kittens selecting for food-poor, high elevations in the heavily hunted population but not in the lightly hunted population. Avoidance of males and selection for high elevations resulted in prey switching by females with kittens from abundant primary prey in lower elevations to rare, sensitive and threatened secondary prey at higher elevations. It appears that remedial sport hunting of mountain lions to reduce predation on declining prey actually caused sexual segregation and increased predation on declining prey. We suggest that excess mortality of male carnivores could result in unanticipated cascade effects including sexual segregation and prey switching to declining prey. (C) 2015 The Authors.

J	Festa-Bianchet, M; Schindler, S; Pelletier, F				Festa-Bianchet, Marco; Schindler, Susanne; Pelletier, Fanie			Record Books Do Not Capture Population Trends in Horn Length of Bighorn Sheep	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Many agencies and researchers use data from harvested animals to study temporal trends in phenotype. For large mammals, complete harvest records are typically only available for the past few decades, but records of the largest trophies have been collected for over a century. To examine whether record books and data from male bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) harvested under a minimum-curl regulation could detect temporal trends in horn length, we simulated populations of trophy-harvested male bighorn sheep where horn length was modeled to increase, remain stable, and decrease over time. All populations experienced a simulated harvest based on a minimum horn length, but only horns in the longest 5% of the initial distribution were entered in a fictional record book. We then assessed whether monitoring of harvested and "record" males detected temporal trends. Data from selective harvest underestimated declines and initially underestimated increases, but qualitatively detected both trends. Record-book entries, however, severely underestimated increases and did not detect declines, suggesting that they should not be used to monitor population trends. When these biases are taken into account, complete trophy harvest records can provide useful biological information.

Horn size and nutrition in mountain sheep: Can ewe handle the truth?	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Horns, antlers, and other horn-like structures are products of sexual selection, confer reproductive advantages, and are heritable and honest indicators of individual quality. In addition to serving key biological functions, horns and antlers garner societal interest that, when combined with the powerful motivation to acquire trophy animals, likely has spawned a growing hornographic culture fixated on males with exceptional horn-like structures. The concern that harvest of large, fast-growing males may cause evolutionary change to the very trait being sought has been the source of controversy in the popular and scientific literature over the past 2 decades. Mountain sheep (i.e., bighorn and thinhorn; Ovis spp.), possibly the only large ungulates in North America managed almost exclusively as trophy species throughout their ranges, embody this controversy, which has led to polarizing views among scientists and stakeholders as to how mountain sheep should be managed. Our goal in this commentary was to discuss the relative contributions of the key ecological and intrinsic factors that influence horn growth, how those factors might interact with harvest strategies, and identify what determinants of horn size are most amenable to management and most effective in achieving desired outcomes. Despite repeated results demonstrating that age or nutrition frequently override genetic contributions to size of horns, attention has been given to the role of genetics and its relationship to harvest of mountain sheep. Given the hyperbole surrounding trophy management and big horns, we suggest the importance of females in the management of mountain sheep has been largely forgotten. Maternal condition can instigate life-long effects on size and growth of males (via maternal effects), and abundance of females, in turn, affects nutritional limitation within populations through density-dependent feedbacks. If production of males with large horns is an objective, we contend that management programs should, integrate monitoring of nutritional status of populations, and where evidence indicates nutritional limitation through density dependence, seek to regulate abundance and per capita nutrition via harvest of females. We propose that extrinsic regulation (i.e., removal by harvest or translocation) is the most effective way to manage per capita availability of forage resources and, thus, nutritional limitation on growth of males. Not only can female harvest improve growth in body size and horns of males through enhanced nutrition of growing males and their mothers, such management also 1) may yield a nutritional buffer against environmental stochasticity and erratic population fluctuations, 2) be employed in areas where other management alternatives such as habitat manipulation may not be feasible, 3) may reduce frequency or magnitude of epizootic die-offs, and 4) will increase hunter opportunity and involvement in management. Ultimately, we call for greater recognition of the pervasive role of the ewe, and other female ungulates, in the production of trophy males, and that accordingly, females be better integrated into harvest and management programs.

J	Balciauskas, L				Balciauskas, Linas			Roe Deer, Lithuania's Smallest and Most Abundant Cervid	FORESTS												A review of 113 scientific and other publications on the smallest and most abundant deer in Lithuania, the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), is presented, along with an analysis based on compound annual population growth rates of population numbers, hunting bags, and roadkill. This review covers the species' history in the country from the last glaciation onwards, the changes in numbers from 1934 to 2023, hunting bag changes from 1965 to 2022, roadkill numbers from 2002 to 2022, data on roe deer reproduction, habitat selection, genetic diversity, pathogens, and damage to forest stands. It also provides an overview of species management and selection for trophies. Despite the exponential increase in roe deer numbers since 1990 and the dominance of this species in roadkill, even on urban roads, the number and density of animals and the damage they cause to forest stands are relatively low compared to other European countries. Within the observed period, drops in numbers were related to harsh winters in 1969/1970 and 1995/1996. Poaching, especially coinciding with weakened enforcement during the period of political-economic transition in the early 1990s, has also had a negative impact on population numbers, as have recent increases in the number of large predators. Population growth over the recent period does not correlate with hunting mortality, which has remained stable at an average of 16.9% since 2002.

We used data on antler size of 1390 red deer males harvested during hunting seasons 2014/2015-2018/2019 in Slovakia to test the hypothesis that spatial variation in the size of antlers, including number of tines, mass and length of antlers, is related to environmental conditions such as availability of calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen in soils and deer density. We found that overall hunting value of antlers including number of tines, mass and length of antlers were higher in areas with higher availability of the CaCO3, P and N in soils. Moreover, we found no signs of decline in the overall score and in number of tines when availability of CaCO3 was high, in the length of antler when availability of P was high, and in the antler mass when availability of N was high. Deer density had negative effect on the antler size including the number of tines and antler length and had no effect on the onset of the peak and rate of decline except for the antler mass. Understanding the extent to which environment influences antler size in cervids is important to develop structured and region-specific policies.

The controlled breeding of red deer in the Sepreshat polygon is the result of long-term game management in open hunting grounds, scientific research, monitoring the state of game in hunting grounds, and supply and demand. One of the reasons for controlled breeding of red deer in Croatia is certainly the reduction in population abundance of this species in the majority of hunting grounds after the Homeland War. The second reason was the intended aim of increasing the trophy quality of deer game, due to devastation of the gene fund. Issues such as the appearance of disease and parasites (giant liver fluke) demand controlled breeding and production of a healthy population that will replace the loss of the natural population. Research to monitoring growth intervals, body and trophy development, breeding technology and the justification of this type of breeding and protection of red deer was carried out in parallel with the targeted breeding of red deer. The primary objective of management at the Sepreshat polygon is the breeding of high quality Baranja red deer, with the possibility of distributing high quality breeding stock to other hunting grounds in the Republic of Croatia. The population of red deer in Baranja has very high genetic potential, and for this reason, it was used earlier in relocations to other parts of Croatia, the neighboring countries, and even to New Zealand. Researching the controlled breeding of red deer was carried out in the period 2005-2009 at the Sepreshat polygon. The Sepreshat polygon is part of the state-owned Podunavlje-Podravlje hunting ground in Baranja. Breeding of game in this polygon began in 2001, for the purpose of studying and preserving the gene fund of the red deer. The polygon originally had only 53 ha, but was gradually expanded with the addition of two fields. Therefore, in 2002, it was expanded to 58 hectares and to 66 ha in 2003. Today, the breeding grounds cover an area of 88 ha, additional areas of 56 ha, and in the most recent expansion of an area for the maturation of trophy red deer of 237 ha, resulting in a total area of 380 ha. The analysis of results of the five-year study of controlled game breeding in the Sepreshat polygon proves that the establishment of breeding grounds was made, given the population dynamics, growth intervals and potential for the sale of live game, as well as the commercial hunting of high quality trophy heads. It should be stressed that the breeding of deer game is a long process and that the first results can only be expected after five years, after the breeding stock is formed and stabilized and normal reproduction begins. The population dynamics of the red deer fund from the start of establishment of the breeding stock to the first significant results of the live game is shown in Table 1. During the five year selection of red deer for mating, only three to four of the most promising male deer (stags) were given the opportunity to mate each year. Each was placed in a separate polygon with fertile females (hinds) including young hinds participating in mating for the first time, in the ratio 1:11 to 1:16, (Table 2). The results indicate that the optimal mating ratio is one stag to ten to twelve hinds. With an increase in the sex ratio, the growth interval coefficient is reduced. This is unfavorable as the goal is to obtain the highest possible calves. One of the main parameters in the selection of young is the weight of the calf at the age of 3 weeks. The minimum level is 10 kg for a female calf and 12 kg for a male calf, as all weights beneath this are unsuitable for further breeding. Measurements also indicated that the highest growth interval of body weight was achieved at the age of 15 to 18 months (Fig. 1). One of the most important segments of maintaining good animal condition, good reproduction and good growth interval is securing sufficient and high quality food throughout the year. Though grass mixtures were sown in the polygon, in effect establishing pastures thereby allowing for the principle of polygon grazing, cultures were sown on additional surfaces to produce food for the game. Nonetheless, the backbone of the diet is the food provided to the game at the feeding sites. In line with the number of game animals in the breeding ground (according to the normative diet and real needs), some 200 tones of various foods, minerals and vitamin supplements were provided each year (Fig. 2 and 3), which represents an expense of HRK 361 000. Feed was the most significant financial expense in the management project, and accounted for 86% of the total breeding ground costs (excluding professional staff salaries and utility expenses) (Fig. 4). With revenues generated by the sale of live game and trophy hunts from the Sepreshat polygon, a positive balance can only be expected in the coming period, which is indicated by the analysis of operations in 2009, the first year that revenues exceeded expenditures. Based on the research conducted, it can be concluded that the breeding of red deer in the Sepreshat polygon is justified, as is the conservation of the gene fund of the Baranja red deer and its relocation to other hunting grounds for the purpose of improving trophy quality and for the economic justification of controlled deer breeding.

These studies have mostly been performed in species with high sexual size dimorphism, subject to intense sexual selection. Here, we examined the relationships between horn growth and several survival metrics in the weakly dimorphic Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica). In this unhunted population living at high density, males and females were able to grow long horns without any apparent costs in terms of longevity. However, we found a negative relationship between horn growth and survival during prime age in males. This association reduces the potential evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting in male chamois. We also found that females with long horns tended to have lower survival at old ages. Our results illustrate the contrasting conclusions that may be drawn when different survival metrics are used in analyses. The ability to detect trade-off between the expression of male secondary sexual traits and survival may depend more on environmental conditions experienced by the population than on the strength of sexual selection.					; Bonenfant, Christophe/I-8645-2019	Douhard, Mathieu/0000-0001-9422-7270; Loison, Anne/0000-0002-4252-0392; Bonenfant, Christophe/0000-0002-9924-419X													2045-7758					MAR	2020	10	6					2793	2802		10.1002/ece3.6050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6050		FEB 2020						32211156					WOS:000516152300001
J	Forsyth, DM				Forsyth, DM			Long-term harvesting and male migration in a New Zealand population of Himalayan tahr Hemitragus jemlahicus	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Sexual differences in behaviour and ecology have important implications for the management of harvested ungulate populations. 2. This study investigated the long-term effects of harvesting on the abundance and distribution of sexes within an introduced population of Himalayan tahr in the Two Thumb and Sibbald Ranges, New Zealand. Annual counts of tahr were made from 1984 to 1996 in two catchments subject to different harvest regimes. 3. Although populations in the two catchments increased at similar rates over the study period, their adult sex ratios diverged significantly in the late 1980s. In Carneys Creek, which was subject to unrestricted harvest, the adult sex ratio was initially equivalent to the estimated population sex ratio, but from 1991 it was significantly male-biased. In North Branch, 10 km from Carneys Creek but subject only to adult (trophy) male harvest, the population was significantly female-biased in all years. 4. There was a large and male-biased harvest in Carneys Creek in 1993, suggesting that immigration of males may have been responsible for the long-term changes in sex ratio observed there. In contrast, the harvest of males in North Branch was insufficient to explain its female-biased population. 5. Monthly counts of male and female tahr in Carneys Creek between December 1993 and February 1996 revealed a consistent seasonal change in the abundance of subadult males, and perhaps adult males, but not females. Sub-adult males immigrated into Carneys Creek during spring, increasing to a summer maximum before emigrating during autumn; few sub-adult males were present during winter. 6. Counts at six additional sites during summer and autumn 1996 indicated that the probable source of these males was an adjacent hunting reserve. This hunting reserve, which included North Branch, contained a female-biased population with moderate female density. 7. The observed changes appear to have been a consequence of sexual differences in habitat selection and mobility. In particular, outside the rut the larger-bodied males avoided habitats containing high densities of females. 8. Harvesting has the potential to affect the spatial distribution of age-sex classes for sexually dimorphic ungulates. Managers need to consider these effects when designing and interpreting harvest and monitoring programmes.

Modeling the impact of selective harvesting on red deer antlers	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Hunting is a common component in the management of ungulate species. Despite its widespread use, the influence of selective harvesting on phenotypic trait change is still ambiguous, and represents a critical gap in our understanding of the responses of wild populations under harvest. Using the long-term red deer (Cervus elaphus) dataset (1972-2012) from the Isle of Rum National Nature Reserve, Scotland, we assessed the relationship between antler length and key demographic processes (i.e., survival, recruitment, antler growth, parent-offspring trait correlation) for the male component of the population. We then constructed the first integral projection model for this species to examine the effects of simulated trophy hunting on 2 population-level parameters: the stable antler size distribution and the relative reproductive value of males. When male mortality rates due to hunting were <20%, the effect on antler size distribution and the reproductive value function were relatively small. However, as mortality due to hunting increased to 50% in large individuals, the direct effects of hunting on mean antler size and reproductive value became evident. Our model acts as a useful starting point to investigate the ecological and evolutionary consequences of hunting in red deer. (c) 2016 The Wildlife Society.

Studies dedicated to understanding the evolutionary consequences of human-induced selection on all levels of diversity (species, populations, traits, genes) provide direct knowledge about the mechanisms underlying species' responses and their evolutionary potential. A better understanding of the effects of human-induced selection is needed to leverage evolved mechanisms to develop appropriate conservation programmes to guarantee the maintenance of healthy systems. In this special issue, we focus on different types of human-mediated selection pressures, from the direct harvesting of individuals (e.g. hunting, fishing), to the more pervasive effects of climate change. Contributions highlight the diversity of human-induced selection pressures ranging from fisheries, trophy-hunting, poaching and domestication to climate change, and pollution. With those, we question whether there are parallel evolutionary solutions across fisheries systems, whether hunting pressures alter population dynamics and population structure, and whether climate change is an evolutionary dead-end. The contributions reflect the direction of travel of the field and the solutions to mitigate the impact of human activities.

J	von Heiseler, TN				von Heiseler, Till Nikolaus			The Social Origin of the Concept of Truth - How Statements Are Built on Disagreements	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY												This paper proposes a social account for the origin of the truth value and the emergence of the first declarative sentence. Such a proposal is based on two assumptions. The first is known as the social intelligence hypothesis: that the cognitive evolution of humans is first and foremost an adaptation to social demands. The second is the function-first approach to explaining the evolution of traits: before a prototype of a new trait develops and the adaptation process begins, something already existing is used for a new purpose. Applied to the emergence of declarative sentences, this suggests something already existing-natural signs (which have a logical or causal relation to what they denote)-were used for the declarative function and thereby integrated (in the form of indexical objects implying a past action) into communication. I show that the display of an indexical object (such as the display of hunting trophies) can imply a conceptual structure similar to that informing the syntax of sentences. The view developed in this paper is broadly consistent with the argumentative theory of Mercier and Sperber, which suggests that reasoning is less adapted to decision making than to social purposes such as winning disputes or justifying one's actions. In this paper I extend this view to the origin of the concept of truth. According to my proposal, the first declarative sentence (articulated in a simple sign language) emerged as a negation of a negation of an implicit statement expressed by the display of an indexical object referring to a past action. Thereby, I suggest that the binary structure of the truth value underlying any declarative sentence is founded on disagreements based on conflicts of interest. Thus, I deny that the concept of truth could have evolved for instrumental reasons such as solving problems, or through self-questioning about what one ought to believe.						von Heiseler, Till Nikolaus/0000-0002-0601-5487													1664-1078					APR 28	2020	11								733	10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00733	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00733								32411047					WOS:000533423700001
J	Miller, JM; Festa-Bianchet, M; Coltman, DW				Miller, Joshua M.; Festa-Bianchet, Marco; Coltman, David W.			Genomic analysis of morphometric traits in bighorn sheep using the Ovine Infinium® HD SNP BeadChip	PEERJ												Elucidating the genetic basis of fitness-related traits is a major goal of molecular ecology. Traits subject to sexual selection are particularly interesting, as non-random mate choice should deplete genetic variation and thereby their evolutionary benefits. We examined the genetic basis of three sexually selected morphometric traits in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis): horn length, horn base circumference, and body mass. These traits are of specific concern in bighorn sheep as artificial selection through trophy hunting opposes sexual selection. Specifically, horn size determines trophy status and, in most North American jurisdictions, if an individual can be legally harvested. Using between 7,994-9,552 phenotypic measures from the long-term individual-based study at Ram Mountain (Alberta, Canada), we first showed that all three traits are heritable (h(2) = 0.15-0.23).Wethen conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) utilizing a set of 3,777 SNPs typed in 76 individuals using the Ovine Infinium (R) HD SNP BeadChip. We found suggestive association for body mass at a single locus (OAR9_91647990). The absence of strong associations with SNPs suggests that the traits are likely polygenic. These results represent a step forward for characterizing the genetic architecture of fitness related traits in sexually dimorphic ungulates.

Motivations and satisfaction of North Dakota deer hunters during a temporal decline in deer populations	HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS												Achieving state wildlife agency biological goals for deer (Odocoileus spp.) management may often conflict with hunter desires. Concomitantly, better information is needed to optimize agency deer herd management goals with hunters' social goals. In 2016, we surveyed 3,000 North Dakota, USA, resident deer hunters using a self-administered mail survey to gain a better understanding of motivations, satisfaction, and hunter demographics that may be used to inform hunter recruitment and retention (HRR) efforts during a period of reduced statewide deer populations. With deer-gun license availability strictly limited, we explored the possibility that some gun hunters may have been engaging in archery deer hunting as a substitute activity. We also explored motivations for deer hunting in North Dakota by segregating respondents into n = 2 groups: those who preferred deer hunting with a gun vs. those who preferred archery equipment. We then compared ratings of 8 hunting motivations (meat, trophy, nature, excitement, social, skills, challenge, and solitude) by preferred hunting implement and gender differences. We further defined primary motivation by their selection of the most important motivation for participation in North Dakota deer hunting. A majority (58%) of archery hunter applicants preferred to hunt deer with a gun; 42% preferred a bow. Respondents who preferred hunting with archery equipment were slightly more motivated by nature aspects of the hunt whereas those who preferred hunting with a gun placed slightly more value on social aspects. Among motivation ratings, social was rated similarly by females and males, and females rated meat as significantly more important for hunting deer. We used logistic regression to test for differences in satisfaction in relation to deer hunter attributes; probability of satisfaction increased with harvest success, preference for hunting with archery equipment, and nature and social motivations for hunting. A proportion of deer-gun hunters who were restricted by lower license availability via lottery may have turned to archery deer hunting as an alternative. Therefore, typical HRR messages aimed at archery hunters (e.g., nature, challenge) may not resonate as well with North Dakota archery deer license applicants who appeared to be less challenge-oriented than socially-oriented.

Both environmental conditions and selective hunting can affect horn growth but their relative importance remains unexplored. We first examined how a large-scale climate index, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), local weather and population density influenced both absolute and relative annual horn growth from birth to three years of male bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis over 42 years. We then examined the relative influence of environmental conditions and evolution mainly driven by trophy hunting on male horn length at three years of age. Horn growth was positively influenced by low population density and warm spring temperature, suggesting that ongoing climate change should lead to larger horns. Seasonal values of PDO were highly correlated. Horn growth increased with PDO in spring or summer at low density, but was weak at high density regardless of PDO. The interaction between population density and PDO in spring or summer accounted for a similar proportion of the observed annual variation in horn growth (32% or 37%) as did the additive effects of spring temperature and density (34%). When environmental conditions deteriorated, males allocated relatively more resources to summer mass gain than to horn growth, suggesting a conservative strategy favoring maintenance of condition over allocation to secondary sexual characters. Population density explained 27% of the variation in horn length, while evolutionary effects explained 9% of the variance. Thus, our study underlines the importance of both evolution and phenotypic plasticity on the development of a secondary sexual trait.					; Coltman, David/A-4453-2012; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/AER-0364-2022; Pigeon, Gabriel/AAM-9214-2020	Pelletier, Fanie/0000-0002-0113-5412; Coltman, David/0000-0002-1268-2307; 													0030-1299	1600-0706				JUL	2017	126	7					1031	1041		10.1111/oik.03799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.03799													WOS:000404628700012

Interest has grown in their production potential, intensifying animal husbandry and breeding approaches. However, little scientific information is available regarding the intensive management of this species, including information regarding scientifically based selection criteria for breeding bulls. Often, simple phenotypic traits are utilised unless high-value game animals are being bred, with horn and body size often being the only traits considered for breeding bulls. This study provides basic information about the reproductive tract morphology, symmetry, and their relationships with secondary sexual traits, social rank, and temperament in common eland. Six eland males (2-2.5 years old; 203 +/- 20 kg) were utilised for the study. Social rank, body weight and body condition score, temperament score, and horn size were determined before the animals were culled, and their reproductive tracts were collected for morphometric and histological evaluation. Results indicate relatively low asymmetry in bilateral reproductive tract components. Individual traits of eland bulls such as age, body weight, and social rank correlated the development of some testicular morphologies and thus may possibly be used in zoos, game ranching, and commercial production for the selection of breeding males, but not temperament and horn length, which should be carefully evaluated. Whilst this study provides baseline information from a limited sample size, further studies should incorporate the assessment of testicular hemodynamics, as well as the effects of factors such as season and androgen secretion patterns over a wider age range of common eland males and populations to provide further information for the management practices of breeding common eland bulls.

J	Boukal, DS; Berec, L; Krivan, V				Boukal, David S.; Berec, Ludek; Krivan, Vlastimil			Does Sex-Selective Predation Stabilize or Destabilize Predator-Prey Dynamics?	PLOS ONE												Background: Little is known about the impact of prey sexual dimorphism on predator-prey dynamics and the impact of sex-selective harvesting and trophy hunting on long-term stability of exploited populations. Methodology and Principal Findings: We review the quantitative evidence for sex-selective predation and study its long-term consequences using several simple predator-prey models. These models can be also interpreted in terms of feedback between harvesting effort and population size of the harvested species under open-access exploitation. Among the 81 predator-prey pairs found in the literature, male bias in predation is 2.3 times as common as female bias. We show that long-term effects of sex-selective predation depend on the interplay of predation bias and prey mating system. Predation on the 'less limiting' prey sex can yield a stable predator-prey equilibrium, while predation on the other sex usually destabilizes the dynamics and promotes population collapses. For prey mating systems that we consider, males are less limiting except for polyandry and polyandrogyny, and male-biased predation alone on such prey can stabilize otherwise unstable dynamics. On the contrary, our results suggest that female-biased predation on polygynous, polygynandrous or monogamous prey requires other stabilizing mechanisms to persist. Conclusions and Significance: Our modelling results suggest that the observed skew towards male-biased predation might reflect, in addition to sexual selection, the evolutionary history of predator-prey interactions. More focus on these phenomena can yield additional and interesting insights as to which mechanisms maintain the persistence of predator-prey pairs over ecological and evolutionary timescales. Our results can also have implications for long-term sustainability of harvesting and trophy hunting of sexually dimorphic species.

J	Vetter, SG; Arnold, W				Vetter, Sebastian G.; Arnold, Walter			Effects of population structure and density on calf sex ratio in red deer (Cervus elaphus)-implications for management	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												There is ongoing interest to assess what factors affect offspring sex ratio, especially in ungulates. Wildlife managers might be interested in influencing this sex ratio for two reasons: either in order to limit population growth more effectively by reducing the proportion of females born or to increase revenues by a higher proportion of trophy bearing males in the population. While previous studies mostly focused on how maternal traits affect offspring sex ratio, we included here also male traits in our analysis. We achieved this by investigating data from 30 areas covering entire Lower Austria, collected over the past 12 years from both hunted red deer and those killed in road accidents. We focused our analyses on parameters that can be easily assessed by managers on the population and individual level, i.e. the numbers of animals culled in different age/sex classes and their body mass. We found that the proportion of females among calves increased with population density. Furthermore, we found that calf sex ratio (i.e. the proportion males among calves aged between 2 and 7 months) increased with increasing proportions of adult females and males older than 10 years, independent of the density effect. We conclude that wildlife managers interested in the effective reduction of red deer abundance and/or increasing the proportion of males among offspring should select a culling regime leading to a low population density dominated by adult, prime-aged females and males. This can be achieved by over-proportional removal of young females and warranting that a high number of strong males reach an age of at least 10 years.

J	Bonenfant, C; Pelletier, F; Garel, M; Bergeron, P				Bonenfant, Christophe; Pelletier, Fanie; Garel, Mathieu; Bergeron, Patrick			Age-dependent relationship between horn growth and survival in wild sheep	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Trade-offs in resource allocation underline the evolution of life-history traits but their expression is frequently challenged by empirical findings. In large herbivores, males with large antlers or horns typically have high mating success. The fitness costs of large horns or antlers have rarely been quantified although they are controversial. Here, using detailed longitudinal data on n = 172 bighorn (Ovis canadensis, Shaw) and the capture-mark-recapture methodology, we tested whether early horn growth leads to a survival cost in rams ('trade-off' hypothesis) or if males that can afford rapid horn growth survive better than males of lower phenotypic quality ('phenotypic quality' hypothesis). We also quantified how hunting increased survival costs of bearing large horns. We found an age-specific relationship between horn growth and survival. In all age classes, natural survival was either weakly related to (lambs, adult rams) or positively associated (yearling rams) with early horn growth. Hunting mortality was markedly different from natural mortality of bighorn rams, leading to an artificial negative association between early horn growth and survival. Beginning at age 4, the yearly harvest rate ranged from 12% for males with the smallest horns up to more than 40% for males with the largest horns. Growing large horns early in life is not related to any consistent survival costs, hence supporting the phenotypic quality hypothesis in males of a dimorphic and polygynous large herbivores. Rapid horn growth early in life is, however, strongly counter selected by trophy hunting. We suggest that horn size is a very poor index of reproductive effort and that males modulate their mating activities and energy allocation to horn growth to limit its impact on survival.					; Bonenfant, Christophe/I-8645-2019	Pelletier, Fanie/0000-0002-0113-5412; Bonenfant, Christophe/0000-0002-9924-419X													0021-8790	1365-2656				JAN	2009	78	1					161	171		10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01477.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01477.x								19120602					WOS:000261620800019
J	Degmecic, D; Bicanic, M				Degmecic, Drazen; Bicanic, Milan			Body weight and development of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) in eastern Slavonia and Baranja	SUMARSKI LIST												In many areas of Europe regional differences in growth, body size and daily growth in body weight of fawns have been noticed and recorded. Since both the main aims of hunting management and the directions for selection and breeding measures depend on knowing these characteristics (liveweight after fawning, rate of growth and body development), these data are crucial. for implementing adequate measures designed. for improvement of roe deer breeding. Without long-term data on actual size of population of roe deer and its sex and age structure in a particular hunting ground, not even the best game experts can proscribe adequate breeding measures and rational utilization of roe deer. Without these data it is also impossible to give proper management directions, the implementation of which could enable a permanent high-quality production of roe deer. This paper will point out the existing values in growth and body development of roe deer in eastern Slavonija and Baranja. We also aim to stress the importance of constant monitoring of these values and to show what sort of influence the values of body growth and development have to the trophy value, to successful breeding (number of embryos) and to proper fawn growth as well as what significance these data have for selective and breeding measures. The body weight of fawns in litter was monitored in Haljevo forest, as was the daily increase of fawn body weight. Body weight of fawns, young and breeding stock has been monitored during hunting season in a typical forest habitat of roe deer in Spacva and in a typical field habitat Baranjsko Podunavlje. Research on these three localities confirmed that several values are important for roe deer management: fawn body weight in litter; fast early growth of fawns, death rate during first months of life, body weight of fawns before their first winter, body weight of does, fertility of does, body weight of bucks, trophy structure of bucks.																			0373-1332	1846-9140					2008	132	5-6					245	252																WOS:000258320600003
J	Chapman, NG				Chapman, NG			Reeves' muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) in Great Britain	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR JAGDWISSENSCHAFT												Reeves' muntjac is a sub-tropical deer which was introduced to Britain at the beginning of this century. Many more deliberate releases and accidental escapes from captive collections have occurred up to the present time. Year-round breeding, with the potential for a female to produce a fawn at intervals of seven months, has contributed to their success. For decades muntjac were considered to be a harmless introduction. Nom that dense populations are established, especially in central southern England, their impact on native flora has been recognised. There is a need for more management in many localities.

Researcher Position and Reflexivity in Socio-Ecological Research for CBNRM in Namibia	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES												This paper emphasizes the importance of researcher position and reflexivity for professionals in the ecological and development sciences. We draw on critical discourse analysis (CDA) to analyze a selection of scientific papers written by Namibian Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) professionals and their relationships with public discourse regarding this conservation and development program. These papers mainly show "success" whilst disregarding "failure" of elements in the program that elsewhere are highly criticized (especially trophy hunting and ecotourism). In addition, they seem to disregard questions concerning researchers' conflicts of interest that bear on the papers' "objectivity." We argue that such positions beg more transparency and epistemological accountability. In particular, we propose greater disclosure and reflexivity regarding researcher positioning as an important methodological response for illuminating when and how researchers have an interest in specific outcomes of their research, so as to enhance interpretation of the knowledge produced by such research.

Terry			Antler size of Alaskan moose Alces alces gigas:: effects of population density, hunter harvest and use of guides	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												Moose Alces alces gigas in Alaska, USA, exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, with adult males possessing large, elaborate antlers. Antler size and conformation are influenced by age, nutrition and genetics, and these bony structures serve to establish social rank and affect mating success. Population density, combined with anthropogenic effects such as harvest, is thought to influence antler size. Antler size increased as densities of moose decreased, ostensibly a density-dependent response related to enhanced nutrition at low densities. The vegetation type where moose were harvested also affected antler size, with the largest-antlered males occupying more open habitats. Hunts with guides occurred in areas with low moose density, minimized hunter interference and increased rates of success. Such hunts harvested moose with larger antler spreads than did non-guided hunts. Knowledge and abilities allowed guides to satisfy demands of trophy hunters, who are an integral part of the Alaskan economy. Heavy harvest by humans was also associated with decreased antler size of moose, probably via a downward shift in the age structure of the population resulting in younger males with smaller antlers. Nevertheless, density-dependence was more influential than effects of harvest on age structure in determining antler size of male moose. Indeed, antlers are likely under strong sexual selection, but we demonstrate that resource availability influenced the distribution of these sexually selected characters across the landscape. We argue that understanding population density in relation to carrying capacity (K) and the age structure of males is necessary to interpret potential consequences of harvest on the genetics of moose and other large herbivores. Our results provide researchers and managers with a better understanding of variables that affect the physical condition, antler size, and perhaps the genetic composition of populations, which may be useful in managing and modelling moose populations.

Extinction risks are amplified through the common practice of trophy hunting for males, which makes setting sustainable hunting quotas a vital task. Various demographic models evaluate consequences of hunting on lion population growth. However, none of the models use unbiased estimates of male age-specific mortality because such estimates do not exist. Until now, estimating mortality from resighting records of marked males has been impossible due to the uncertain fates of disappeared individuals: dispersal or death. We develop a new method and infer mortality for male and female lions from two populations that are typical with respect to their experienced levels of human impact. We found that mortality of both sexes differed between the populations and that males had higher mortality across all ages in both populations. We discuss the role that different drivers of lion mortality may play in explaining these differences and whether their effects need to be included in lion demographic models.Synthesis and applications. Our mortality estimates can be used to improve lion population management and, in addition, the mortality model itself has potential applications in demographically informed approaches to the conservation of species with sex-biased dispersal.

This is especially important for those kinds of game, the males of which have a trophy. The density of population, dominance of hinds in the population and the amount of precipitation during winter (November-January), are definitely factors that influence the amount of food available (the first is negatively dependant, whereas the other two factors have a positive dependency on food availability), i.e. on the nourishment of the hinds. According to Flint et al. (1997) and Enright et al. (2001), the hinds that are better nourished give birth to a higher percentage of male calves, regardless if we are talking about red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) or fallow deer (Dama dama L.). Kojola's research (1997) has confirmed similar results for reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.), and Wauters et al. (1995) for roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.). The research of the factors that may influence the sex of a red deer calf (Cervus elaphus L.) has been conducted in the Slate hunting ground number XIV/9 "PODUNAVLJE - PODRAVLJE ". The hunting ground is situated in Baranja alongside the rivers Danube and Drava. The hunting ground is managed by the company Hrvatske sume d.o.o. Zagreb, Uprava suma podruznica Osijek. This paper is based on the call data of the hinds ill the hunting ground during the hunting seasons 2007/2008 (42 head) and 2008/2009 (23 head). The following data has been recorded and analyzed: net body weight of the hinds (body weight of eviscerated head with skin, without head and feet (carpal and tarsal parts of the extremities)); also during evisceration, embryos or foetuses were removed from uterus, weighed on a grant scale and their sex was determined in utero (Figure 2. and 3.). The research did not find differences that would point to this particular factor, although there is a change in ratio of male and female foetuses. For the hunting season 2007/2008 sex ratio, was 1:21 (45:55 %) for the female foetuses, and a year after 1,09:1 (52:48 %) for the male foetuses (Table 1.). The cause of the irregular sex ratio in the hunting season 2007/2008 could be an extremely hot and very dry summer in 2007, or the difference could simply be caused by the sample examined. It was found that the sex ratio of the culled hinds in two consecutive hunting seasons (2007/2008 and 2008/2009) was different (1:21, and 1.09:1 respectively). The results of the net body weight tests for the hinds, as one of the key parameters for the population, did not show a significant relevance for determining the sex of future calves. However, although statistically insignificant, a climate difference in the summers of the two hunting seasons was recorded.

J	Festa-Bianchet, M; Coltman, DW; Turelli, L; Jorgenson, JT				Festa-Bianchet, M; Coltman, DW; Turelli, L; Jorgenson, JT			Relative allocation to horn and body growth in bighorn rams varies with resource availability	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												Males may allocate a greater proportion of metabolic resources to maintenance than to the development of secondary sexual characters when food is scarce, to avoid compromising their probability of survival. We assessed the effects of resource availability on body mass and horn growth of bighorn rams (Ovis canadensis) at Ram Mountain, Alberta, Canada over 30 years. The number of adult ewes in the population tripled during our study, and the average mass of yearling females decreased by 13%. We used the average mass of yearling females as an index of resource availability. Yearling female mass was negatively correlated with the body mass of rams of all ages, but it affected horn growth only during the first three years of life. Yearly horn growth was affected by a complex interaction of age, body mass, and resource availability. Among rams aged 2-4 years, the heaviest individuals had similar horn growth at high and at low resource availability, but as ram mass decreased, horn growth for a given body mass became progressively smaller with decreasing resource availability. For rams aged 5-9 years, horn growth was weakly but positively correlated with body mass, and rams grew slightly more horn for a given body mass as resource availability decreased. When food is limited, young rams may direct more resources to body growth than to horn growth, possibly trading long-term reproductive success for short-term survival. Although horn growth of older rams appeared to be greater at low than at high resource availability, we found no correlation between early and late growth in horn length for the same ram, suggesting that compensatory horn growth does not occur in our study population. Young rams with longer horns were more likely to be shot by sport hunters than those with shorter horns. Trophy hunting could select against rams with fast-growing horns.

Estimating poaching mortality is challenging, as the evidence for illegal killing is not outwardly obvious. Using resighting and recovery data collected on 141 marked red deer Cervus elaphus within the Stelvio National Park (central Italian Alps), we show how multievent models allow to assess the direct impacts of illegal harvesting on age- and sex-specific survival, accounting for uncertainty over mortality causes.ResultsMortality caused by poaching was consistently higher for males than for females in all age classes. In males, the probability of dying from poaching was higher for extreme age classes, while in females all age classes showed fairly similar values of poaching mortality. The strong bias in sex-specific poaching mortality was possibly due to trophy killing in adult males and bushmeat-like' killing for private or commercial gain in young males and in females.ConclusionsA robust assessment of age- and sex-specific prevalence of poaching in wildlife populations is pivotal when illegal killing is of conservation concern. This provides timely information on what segment of the population is most likely to be affected. Besides obvious demographic consequences on small populations, age- and sex-biased poaching prevalence may contrast with the need to maintain ecosystem complexity and may alter behavioral responses to human presence. The information provided by multievent models, whose flexibility makes them adaptable to many systems where individual-based data is part of population monitoring, offers a support to design appropriate strategies for the conservation of wildlife populations.

Using a sign-based index of abundance, we measured 6-year trends in abundance and habitat use of five ungulate species after poaching ceased at a site in Thailand. Regression slopes of annual indices against time indicated population growth rates (r) of 0.44 and 0.31 for muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) and gaur (Bos gaurus), respectively-close to the intrinsic rates of natural increase for similarly-sized ungulates. Thus, muntjac and gaur can recover relatively rapidly from low population levels. In contrast, sambar (Cervus unicolor) remained consistently rare despite freedom from hunting, perhaps because prime males had been selectively targeted for trophies, disrupting the species mating system. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) were already relatively abundant when monitoring started, illustrating their resilience to hunting and ability to quickly recolonize disturbed areas. Gaur herds (the key demographic unit of the population) and muntjac consistently selected deciduous over evergreen forest as their populations increased, revealing the importance of food-rich deciduous forest in driving recovery of these species. The unexpected failure of sambar to recover suggests that reproductive behavior may override seemingly positive interventions (i.e., stopping poaching) that reduce mortality. Small but well-protected recovery zones set within forested areas might help propel population recovery of ungulates and increase the prey base for endangered tigers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

B.			Reproductive success of female leopards Panthera pardus: the importance of top-down processes	MAMMAL REVIEW												Long-term studies on large felids are rare and yet they yield data essential to understanding the behaviour of species and the factors that facilitate their conservation. We used the most extensive data set so far compiled on leopards Panthera pardus to establish baseline reproductive parameters for females and to determine the demographic and environmental factors that affect their lifetime reproductive success. We used comprehensive sightings reports and photographs from ecotourism lodges in the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, South Africa, to reconstruct life histories for 44 female leopards that gave birth to 172 litters over a 32-year period. Leopards appeared to exhibit a birth pulse; most litters were born in the wet season, particularly in December. Mean age at first parturition (n=26, mean +/- standard error=46 +/- 2 months, range=33-62) was older than previously recorded, possibly due to elevated intraspecific competition. Average litter size was 1.9 +/- 0.1 (n=140, range=1-3) and declined with maternal age. Age of litters at independence (n=52, 19 +/- 1 months, range=9-31) was inversely related to prey abundance but did not affect the likelihood of recruitment of offspring. Interbirth intervals differed following successful litters (in which at least one cub survived to independence; n=55, 25 +/- 1 months, range=14-39) and unsuccessful litters (n=46, 11 +/- 1 months, range=4-36), as did the time taken to replace litters. Variation in lifetime reproductive success was influenced mainly by differences in cub survival, which was related to maternal age and vulnerability to infanticide. Cub survival (37%) declined as females got older, perhaps because mothers relinquished portions of their home ranges to philopatric daughters. Male leopards were responsible for many (40%) cub deaths and females appeared to adopt severalstrategies to counter the risk of infanticide, including paternity confusion and displaying a period of reduced fertility immediately after a resident male was replaced. Our results suggest that the reproductive success of female leopards is regulated primarily by top-down processes. This should be taken into account in management decisions, particularly when managers are considering the implementation of invasive activities such as legal trophy hunting.

Multi-trait genetic evaluation for horn traits of economic importance in the Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer)	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												The wildlife industry in South Africa has shown immense growth since the 1990s, which was brought about by the private game segment of the industry. In recent years, trophy quality Cape buffalo breeding animals have achieved extremely high prices. Much of the economic value of these animals can be attributed to horn size, which is important for breeding and hunting purposes. The main objective of the study was to estimate variance components for horn traits of economic importance as well as to develop guidelines for recording these traits. To date, no quantitative genetic analysis has been done for any traits in Cape buffalo. The total number of horn measurement records included in the evaluation was n = 945 for outer spread (BHSO), n = 470 for tip to tip (BHTSCI), n = 468 for left boss and n = 479 for right boss. For descriptive statistics, males and females were considered separately while age was divided into clusters of six months. A multi-trait animal model using Monte Carlo Markov Chains methods was used for the estimation of genetic parameters. Results suggest that it is not economically viable to measure horn spread and tip to tip of females after 48 months of age. Horns of the males continue to grow beyond 91 months of age. Boss records were unreliable owing to the applied measurement techniques for female and young animals. An inbreeding coefficient of 0.008 was calculated, suggesting adequate genetic diversity in the studied population. The heritability estimates of the horn traits were low, showing that extreme care has to be taken to develop effective selection programmes for the buffalo game industry using their horn genetic parameters. Further quantitative studies are required to support the results of the current study.

Questionnaire survey of the pan-African trade in lion body parts	PLOS ONE												The African lion is in decline across its range, and consumptive utilisation and trade of their body parts and skins has been postulated as a cause for concern. We undertook a pan-African questionnaire and literature survey to document informed opinion and evidence for the occurrence of domestic and international trade and consumption in African lion body parts across current and former range states. Sixty-five people from 18 countries participated in the online questionnaire survey (run from July 2014 to May 2015), with information provided for 28 countries (including 20 out of 24 countries believed to have extant populations). Respondents were experts within their professional spheres, and 77% had >= 6 years relevant experience within lion conservation or allied wildlife matters. Their opinions revealed wide sub-regional differences in consumptive use, drivers of trade, and access to lions that impact wild lion populations in different ways. Traditional medicine practices (African and Asian) were perceived to be the main uses to which lion body parts and bones are put domestically and traded internationally, and there is reason for concern about persistent imports from former lion range states (mainly in West Africa) for parts for this purpose. The domestic, rather than international, trade in lion body parts was perceived to be a bigger threat to wild lion populations. Parts such as skin, claws, teeth and bones are thought to be in most demand across the continent. The impact of international trade on wild populations was acknowledged to be largely unknown, but occasionally was judged to be 'high', and therefore vigilance is needed to monitor emerging detrimental impacts. Seventeen countries were nominated as priorities for immediate monitoring, including: South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Reasons for their selection include: prevalence of trophy hunting, 'hot spots' for poaching, active domestic trade in lion body parts, trade in curios for the tourist market, and histories of legal-illegal wildlife trade. This survey, and increased incident reports since mid-2015 of lion poisoning and poaching in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa, and sporadic poaching events in Uganda and Tanzania, are signalling an escalating trend in the trade of lion products that is an increasing threat to some national populations. The evidence is sufficient to make more detailed investigation of this trade a conservation priority.

J	Nowak, S; Myslajek, RW				Nowak, Sabina; Myslajek, Robert W.			Wolf recovery and population dynamics in Western Poland, 2001-2012	MAMMAL RESEARCH												Since the mid-twentieth century, under different management regimes (over 20 years of a wolf control program followed by 20 years of trophy hunting), wolves were absent or rare in Western Poland (hereinafter WPL). They became strictly protected in the whole country in 1998 and started to re-settle the vast forests of WPL, far (376 +/- 106.5 km) from the source population in eastern Poland. In 2002-2012, the population increased from several to approximately 140 wolves living in 30 family groups, with an annual rate of increase of 38 % (lambda = 1.38, SE = 0.10). The area of permanent occurrence increased from 600 to 10,900 km(2), with an average density of 1.3 wolves/100 km(2). The nearest neighbour distance between wolf territories decreased from 260 to 25 km. In 2001-2005, half of the settlement efforts by wolves failed after 1-2 years whereas in 2006-2009 only one fifth of newly settled wolves failed to persist > 2 years. The number of wolves in groups varied from 2 to 9, and the mean group size increased from 1.8 in 2001 to 4.8 in 2012. The survival of pups from May to the end of November was 50 % (the mean number of pups per litter was 5.1 and 2.5, respectively). Of 28 wolves found dead, 65 % were killed by vehicles, 25 % were poached, and 7 % died because of diseases and natural factors. All road casualties were young wolves, most of them male (67 %), hit on roads on average 11.6 km from the centre of the nearest pack. The re-colonisation of WPL started from jump dispersal, which allowed wolves to establish packs in distant locations. As the recovery proceeded, the dispersal pattern shifted to being stratified, a mixture of diffusion and jump dispersal that resulted in the creation of packs in close vicinity to existing groups. After 12 years of re-colonisation, wolves in Western Poland occupied about 30 % of potential suitable habitats.					; Mysłajek, Robert/AAD-9569-2022	Nowak, Sabina/0000-0002-7771-8032; Mysłajek, Robert/0000-0001-9619-2868													2199-2401	2199-241X				APR	2016	61	2					83	98		10.1007/s13364-016-0263-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-016-0263-3													WOS:000372880400001

Reproductive tactics in particular may vary as individuals' trade-off current investment versus lifetime fitness. Male African savanna elephants (Loxodona africana) provide a telling example of balancing body growth with reproductive fitness due to the combination of indeterminate growth and strongly delineated periods of sexual activity (musth), which results in reproductive tactics that alter with age. Our study aims to quantify the extent to which male elephants alter their movement patterns, and hence energetic allocation, in relation to (a) reproductive state and (b) age, and (c) to determine whether musth periods can be detected directly from GPS tracking data. We used a combination of GPS tracking data and visual observations of 25 male elephants ranging in age from 20 to 52 years to examine the influence of reproductive state and age on movement. We then used a three-state hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect musth behaviour in a subset of sequential tracking data. Our results demonstrate that male elephants increased their daily mean speed and range size with age and in musth. Furthermore, non-musth speed decreased with age, presumably reflecting a shift towards energy acquisition during non-musth. Thus, despite similar speeds and marginally larger ranges between reproductive states at age 20, by age 50, males were travelling 2.0 times faster in a 3.5 times larger area in musth relative to non-musth. The distinctiveness of musth periods over age 35 meant the three-state HMM could automatically detect musth movement with high sensitivity and specificity, but could not for the younger age class. We show that male elephants increased their energetic allocation into reproduction with age as the probability of reproductive success increases. Given that older male elephants tend to be both the target of legal trophy hunting and illegal poaching, man-made interference could drive fundamental changes in elephant reproductive tactics. Bio-logging, as our study reveals, has the potential both to quantify mature elephant reproductive tactics remotely and to be used to institute proactive management strategies around the reproductive behaviour of this charismatic keystone species.

Remote, non-invasive photogrammetry for measuring physical traits in wildlife	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Morphometric measurements in wildlife are essential data needed to link behaviour and ecology to life-history traits. However, acquisition of such data, especially in large vertebrates, is a challenging and limiting aspect in many studies due to associated capture and handling. Ultimately, this prevents testing important hypotheses in wildlife ecology. We demonstrate how to overcome some of these challenges by improving the far-reaching potential of photogrammetry for wildlife. We validate a methodology using photogrammetry to acquire measurements of complex, curvilinear, morphometric traits (deer antlers) at long range (up to 200 m), providing a methodological foundation for further application to numerous physical attributes and species. We calibrated and validated two different photogrammetric camera systems and applied long-range photogrammetry to measure a suite of antler features from deer trophies positioned analogous to free-living, wild deer. We also developed, validated and described an efficient correction protocol to overcome the complexity of three-dimensional antler features. This complexity previously biased the acquisition of absolute measurements. Our measurement estimates were characterized by mean errors lower than 5% when compared to true sizes, with our correction protocol for antlers particularly effective and validated with independent antler sizes. Importantly, the estimated size rankings based on the true sizes were identical to the rankings estimated by photogrammetry in all cases. We measured antlers in free-living, wild fallow deer as a field validation and demonstration, showing how we were able to collect physical trait measurements of 230 antlers without capture. This non-invasive, remote and fast technique can provide valuable and accurate data allowing researchers to address new hypotheses by linking life-history traits to wildlife ecology, behaviour and management.					; Ciuti, Simone/KHE-4371-2024	Bongi, Paolo/0000-0002-6069-4265; Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509; Smith, Adam Francis/0000-0002-3428-3729													0952-8369	1469-7998				APR	2021	313	4					250	262		10.1111/jzo.12858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12858		DEC 2020											WOS:000602467600001
